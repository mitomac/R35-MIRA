                 and inactive regions known as heterochromatin, or silenced
                 chromatin. This review describes contemporary knowledge and
                 models for how silenced chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
                 forms, functions, and is inherited. In S. cerevisiae, Sir
                 proteins are the key structural components of silenced
                 chromatin. Sir proteins interact first with silencers, which
                 dictate which regions are silenced, and then with histone
                 tails in nucleosomes as the Sir proteins spread from silencers
                 along chromosomes. Importantly, the spreading of silenced
                 chromatin requires the histone deacetylase activity of Sir2p.
                 This requirement leads to a general model for the spreading
                 and inheritance of silenced chromatin or other special
                 chromatin states. Such chromatin domains are marked by
                 modifications of the nucleosomes or DNA, and this mark is able
                 to recruit an enzyme that makes further marks. Thus, among
                 different organisms, multiple forms of repressive chromatin
                 can be formed using similar strategies but completely
                 different proteins. We also describe emerging evidence that
                 mutations that cause global changes in the modification of
                 histones can alter the balance between euchromatin and
                 silenced chromatin within a cell.",

                 Special attention has been paid to the switching of
                 mating-type genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a process
                 initiated by the HO endonuclease by cleaving the MAT locus. A
                 DSB in MATa is repaired by homologous
                 recombination--specifically, by gene conversion--using a
                 heterochromatic donor, HML$\alpha$. Repair results in the
                 replacement of the a-specific sequences (Ya) by Y$\alpha$ and
                 switching from MATa to MAT$\alpha$. We report that MAT

                 by copying homologous sequences from a sister chromatid, a
                 homologous chromosome or an ectopic location. Recombination is
                 challenged by the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes, which may

                 However, nucleosome dynamics during DSB repair have not been
                 well described, primarily because of a lack of well-ordered
                 nucleosomes around a DSB. We designed a system in budding

                 active MATalpha shows that unique organized chromatin
                 structure characterizes the silent state of HMLalpha.
                 Precisely positioned nucleosomes abutting the silencers extend
                 over the alpha1 and alpha2 coding regions. The HO endonuclease
                 recognition site, nuclease hypersensitive at MATalpha, is
                 protected at HMLalpha. Although two precisely positioned
                 nucleosomes incorporate transcription start sites at HMLalpha,
                 the promoter region of the alpha1 and alpha2 genes is
                 nucleosome free and more nuclease sensitive in the repressed
                 than in the transcribed locus. Mutations in genes essential
                 for HML silencing disrupt the nucleosome array near HML-I but
                 not in the vicinity of HML-E, which is closer to the telomere
                 of chromosome III. At the promoter and the HO site, the
                 structure of HMLalpha in Sir protein and histone H4 N-terminal
                 deletion mutants is identical to that of the transcriptionally
                 active MATalpha. The discontinuous chromatin structure of
                 HMLalpha contrasts with the continuous array of nucleosomes
                 found at repressed a-cell-specific genes and the recombination
                 enhancer. Punctuation at HMLalpha may be necessary for
                 higher-order structure or karyoskeleton interactions. The
                 unique chromatin architecture of HMLalpha may relate to the
                 combined requirements of transcriptional repression and

                 its organization into chromatin must be duplicated during cell
                 division. Understanding how entire chromosomes are copied
                 remains a major challenge. Here, we use nascent chromatin
                 capture (NCC) to profile chromatin proteome dynamics during
                 replication in human cells. NCC relies on biotin-dUTP
                 labelling of replicating DNA, affinity purification and
                 quantitative proteomics. Comparing nascent chromatin with
                 mature post-replicative chromatin, we provide association
                 dynamics for 3,995 proteins. The replication machinery and 485
                 chromatin factors such as CAF-1, DNMT1 and SUV39h1 are
                 enriched in nascent chromatin, whereas 170 factors including
                 histone H1, DNMT3, MBD1-3 and PRC1 show delayed association.

                 Finally, we combine NCC enrichment with experimentally derived
                 chromatin probabilities to predict a function in nascent

                 (DDRs), histone deposition, and chromatin maturation at
                 replication forks is difficult in mammalian cells. Here we
                 describe a technology called iPOND (isolation of proteins on
                 nascent DNA) to analyze proteins at active and damaged
                 replication forks at high resolution. Using this methodology,
                 we define the timing of histone deposition and chromatin
                 maturation. Class 1 histone deacetylases are enriched at
                 replisomes and remove predeposition marks on histone H4.
                 Chromatin maturation continues even when decoupled from
                 replisome movement. Furthermore, fork stalling causes changes
                 in the recruitment and phosphorylation of proteins at the
                 damaged fork. Checkpoint kinases catalyze H2AX
                 phosphorylation, which spreads from the stalled fork to
                 include a large chromatin domain even prior to fork collapse
                 and double-strand break formation. Finally, we demonstrate a
                 switch in the DDR at persistently stalled forks that includes
                 MRE11-dependent RAD51 assembly. These data reveal a dynamic

                 measurements of origin firing between strains and conditions.
                 To overcome this limitation, we developed qBrdU-seq, a
                 quantitative method for BrdU incorporation analysis of

                 risks such as the possibility of introducing breaks and/or
                 mutations in the genome. Hence, DNA replication requires the
                 coordinated action of multiple proteins and regulatory
                 factors, whose deregulation causes severe developmental
                 diseases and predisposes to cancer. In recent years, the
                 concept of ``replicative stress'' (RS) has attracted much
                 attention as it impinges directly on genomic stability and
                 offers a promising new avenue to design anticancer therapies.
                 In this review, we summarize recent progress in three areas:

                 regulates gene expression and also modulates replication
                 timing; however, these mechanisms have been suggested to be
                 independent, and no global association has been found between
                 replication timing and gene expression levels. Using
                 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation to generate
                 genome-wide replication profiles, we identified >100
                 late-firing replication origins that are regulated by Rpd3L,
                 which is specifically targeted to promoters to silence
                 transcription. Rpd3S, which recompacts chromatin after
                 transcription, plays a primary role at only a handful of

                 ability of these functionally distinct Rpd3 complexes to
                 affect replication initiation timing supports the idea that
                 histone deacetylation directly influences initiation timing.
                 Accordingly, loss of Rpd3 function results in higher levels of
                 histone H3 and H4 acetylation surrounding Rpd3-regulated
                 origins, and these origins show a significant association with

                 as replication origins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ARSs
                 contain the 17 bp ARS consensus sequence (ACS), which binds
                 the origin recognition complex. The yeast genome contains more
                 than 10,000 ACS matches, but there are only a few hundred
                 origins, and little flanking sequence similarity has been
                 found. Thus, identification of origins by sequence alone has
                 not been possible. RESULTS: We developed an algorithm,
                 Oriscan, to predict yeast origins using similarity to 26
                 characterized origins. Oriscan used 268 bp of sequence,
                 including the T-rich ACS and a 3' A-rich region. The
                 predictions identified the exact location of the ACS. A total
                 of 84 of the top 100 Oriscan predictions, and 56\% of the top
                 350, matched known ARSs or replication protein binding sites.
                 The true accuracy was even higher because we tested 25
                 discrepancies, and 15 were in fact ARSs. Thus, 94\% of the top
                 100 predictions and an estimated 70\% of the top 350 were
                 correct. We compared the predictions to corresponding
                 sequences in related Saccharomyces species and found that the
                 ACSs of experimentally supported predictions show significant
                 conservation. CONCLUSIONS: The high accuracy of the

                 conditions for ARS activity, the A-rich region is a
                 recognizable feature of ARS elements with a probable role in

                 computational analyses. One striking new correlation to emerge
                 from these analyses is between replication timing and the
                 three-dimensional structure of chromosomes. This correlation,
                 which is significantly stronger than with any single histone
                 modification or chromosome-binding protein, suggests that
                 replication timing is controlled at the level of chromosomal
                 domains. This conclusion dovetails with parallel work on the
                 heterogeneity of origin firing and the competition between
                 origins for limiting activators to suggest a model in which
                 the stochastic probability of individual origin firing is
                 modulated by chromosomal domain structure to produce patterns
                 of replication. Whether these patterns have inherent
                 biological functions or simply reflect higher-order genome

                 remains unknown, but they could be a consequence of chromatin
                 structure. The availability of genome-wide maps of nucleosome
                 positions has led to an explosion of information about how

                 combine high-resolution genome-wide nucleosome maps with
                 comprehensive annotations of DNA replication origins to
                 identify patterns of nucleosome occupancy at eukaryotic
                 replication origins. On average, replication origins contain a
                 nucleosome depleted region centered next to the ACS element,
                 flanked on both sides by arrays of well-positioned
                 nucleosomes. Our analysis identified DNA sequence properties
                 that correlate with nucleosome occupancy at replication

                 positioning at replication origins in which the underlying
                 sequence occludes nucleosomes to permit binding of the origin

                 time in oogenesis, somatic follicle cells transition from
                 genomic replication to a locus-specific replication from six
                 amplicon origins. Previous evidence indicated that these

                 molecular biology. In particular, the generation of fusion
                 constructs with epitope tags or fluorescent proteins at the
                 genomic locus facilitates the analysis of protein expression,
                 localization, and interaction partners at physiologic levels.
                 Following up on our initial publication, we now describe a
                 considerably simplified, more efficient, and readily scalable
                 experimental workflow for PCR-based genome editing in cultured
                 Drosophila melanogaster cells. Our analysis at the act5C locus
                 suggests that PCR-based homology arms of 60 bp are sufficient
                 to reach targeting efficiencies of up to 80\% after selection;
                 extension to 80 bp (PCR) or 500 bp (targeting vector) did not
                 further improve the yield. We have expanded our targeting
                 system to N-terminal epitope tags; this also allows the
                 generation of cell populations with heterologous expression
                 control of the tagged locus via the copper-inducible mtnDE
                 promoter. We present detailed, quantitative data on editing
                 efficiencies for several genomic loci that may serve as
                 positive controls or benchmarks in other laboratories. While
                 our first PCR-based editing approach offered only
                 blasticidin-resistance for selection, we now introduce
                 puromycin-resistance as a second, independent selection
                 marker; it is thus possible to edit two loci (e.g., for
                 coimmunoprecipitation) without marker removal. Finally, we
                 describe a modified FLP recombinase expression plasmid that
                 improves the efficiency of marker cassette FLP-out. In
                 summary, our technique and reagents enable a flexible, robust,
                 and cloning-free genome editing approach that can be

                 activated at the G(1)/S transition by Cdc45 and the protein
                 kinases Cdc7 and Cdk2. Paradoxically, the number of
                 chromatin-bound MCM complexes greatly exceeds the number of
                 bound ORC complexes. To understand how the high MCM2-7:ORC
                 ratio comes about, we examined the binding of these proteins
                 to immobilized linear DNA fragments in Xenopus egg extracts.
                 The minimum length of DNA required to recruit ORC and MCM2-7
                 was approximately 80 bp, and the MCM2-7:ORC ratio on this
                 fragment was approximately 1:1. With longer DNA fragments, the
                 MCM2-7:ORC ratio increased dramatically, indicating that MCM
                 complexes normally become distributed over a large region of

                 chromatin-bound MCM2-7 complexes recruited Cdc45 at the onset
                 of DNA replication, and unlike Cdc45, MCM2-7 was not limiting
                 for DNA replication. However, all the chromatin-bound MCM
                 complexes may be functional, because they were phosphorylated

                 This suggests that replication timing is due primarily to ORC

                 of specific cell types, there are often demands for high
                 levels of particular gene products. These demands can be met
                 by increasing transcription or translation, or by decreasing
                 the rate of mRNA or protein turnover. Although these are the
                 most common means to increase expression levels, there is
                 another mechanism: gene amplification. Developmental gene
                 amplification is a DNA replication-based process whereby
                 specific genes are replicated above the copy number of
                 surrounding sequences, resulting in an increase in the
                 template available for transcription. Recent microarray

                 barrier to the encroachment of chromosomal silencing.
                 Endogenous 5'HS4 sequences are highly enriched with histone
                 acetylation and H3K4 methylation regardless of neighboring
                 gene expression. We report here that 5'HS4 elements recruit
                 these histone modifications when protecting a reporter
                 transgene from chromosomal silencing. Deletion studies
                 identified a single protein binding site within 5'HS4,
                 footprint IV, that is necessary for the recruitment of histone
                 modifications and for barrier activity. We have determined
                 that USF proteins bind to footprint IV. USF1 is present in
                 complexes with histone modifying enzymes in cell extracts, and
                 these enzymes specifically interact with the endogenous 5'HS4
                 element. Knockdown of USF1 expression leads to a loss of
                 histone modification recruitment and subsequent encroachment
                 of H3K9 methylation. We propose that barrier activity requires
                 the constitutive recruitment of H3K4 methylation and histone
                 acetylation at multiple residues to counteract the propagation

                 located in telomeres as a repeated unit, and elsewhere in the

                 proposed that G-quadruplexes may be directly involved in gene
                 regulation at the level of transcription. In support of this

                 significantly enriched in quadruplex motifs relative to the

                 identified seven essential subunits of the mRNA cleavage and

                 RAP1-interacting factor (RIF1). Strains carrying gene

                 regions transcribed at moderate levels were generally
                 associated with high replication initiation frequency. In
                 genomic regions with high rates of transcription, very few

                 still largely unknown. Microscopy studies have indicated that
                 specific regions of chromosomes are located in close proximity
                 to the nuclear lamina (NL). This has led to the idea that
                 certain genomic elements may be attached to the NL, which may
                 contribute to the spatial organization of chromosomes inside
                 the nucleus. However, sequences in the human genome that
                 interact with the NL in vivo have not been identified. Here we
                 construct a high-resolution map of the interaction sites of
                 the entire genome with NL components in human fibroblasts.
                 This map shows that genome-lamina interactions occur through
                 more than 1,300 sharply defined large domains 0.1-10 megabases
                 in size. These lamina-associated domains (LADs) are typified
                 by low gene-expression levels, indicating that LADs represent
                 a repressive chromatin environment. The borders of LADs are
                 demarcated by the insulator protein CTCF, by promoters that
                 are oriented away from LADs, or by CpG islands, suggesting
                 possible mechanisms of LAD confinement. Taken together, these
                 results demonstrate that the human genome is divided into

                 of the genome and that large structural variants are
                 preferentially associated with asynchronous replication. We

                 chromosome X inactivation in one of the two individuals tested

                 Analysis of high-resolution TimEX profiles revealed small

                 conserved kinase required for initiation of DNA replication
                 and may affect the site selection and timing of origin firing.
                 We identified rif1$\Delta$, a null mutant of rif1(+), a

                 shown that the Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)
                 origin of replication corresponds to a broad zone of
                 inefficient initiation sites distributed throughout the spacer
                 between the convergently transcribed DHFR and 2BE2121 genes.
                 It is clear from mutational analysis that none of these sites
                 is genetically required for controlling origin activity.
                 However, the integrity of the promoter of the DHFR gene is
                 needed to activate the downstream origin, while the 3'
                 processing signals prevent invasion and inactivation of the
                 downstream origin by transcription forks. Several other
                 origins in metazoans have been shown to correspond to zones of
                 inefficient sites, while a different subset appears to be
                 similar to the fixed replicators that characterize origins in
                 S. cerevisiae and lower organisms. These observations have led
                 us to suggest a model in which the mammalian genome is dotted
                 with a hierarchy of degenerate, redundant, and inefficient
                 replicators at intervals of a kilobase or less, some of which
                 may have evolved to be highly circumscribed and efficient. The
                 activities of initiation sites are proposed to be largely
                 regulated by local transcription and chromatin architecture.
                 Recently, we and others have devised strategies for
                 identifying active origins on a genome-wide scale in order to
                 define their distributions between fixed and dispersive origin
                 types and to detect relationships among origins, genes, and
                 epigenetic markers. The global pictures emerging are
                 suggestive but far from complete and appear to be plagued by
                 some of the same uncertainties that have led to conflicting
                 views of individual origins in the past (particularly DHFR).
                 In this paper, we will trace the history of origin discovery
                 in mammalian genomes, primarily using the well-studied DHFR
                 origin as a model, because it has been analyzed by nearly
                 every available origin mapping technique in several different

                 epigenetic mechanisms restricting the accessibility of origins
                 to limiting initiation factors. About 30\% of these origins
                 are located within repetitive DNA sequences such as the
                 ribosomal DNA (rDNA) array, but their regulation is poorly
                 understood. Here, we have investigated how histone
                 deacetylases (HDACs) control the replication program in
                 budding yeast. This analysis revealed that two HDACs, Rpd3 and
                 Sir2, control replication timing in an opposite manner.
                 Whereas Rpd3 delays initiation at late origins, Sir2 is
                 required for the timely activation of early origins. Moreover,
                 Sir2 represses initiation at rDNA origins, whereas Rpd3
                 counteracts this effect. Remarkably, deletion of SIR2 restored
                 normal replication in rpd3$\Delta$ cells by reactivating rDNA
                 origins. Together, these data indicate that HDACs control the
                 replication timing program in budding yeast by modulating the
                 ability of repeated origins to compete with single-copy

                 important model for understanding the replication of
                 tissue-specific gene loci in mammalian cells. We have observed
                 two DNA replication programs with dramatically different
                 temporal replication patterns for the Igh locus in B-lineage
                 cells. In pro- and pre-B-cell lines and in ex vivo-expanded
                 pro-B cells, the entire locus is replicated early in S phase.
                 In three cell lines that exhibit the early-replication
                 pattern, we found that replication forks progress in both
                 directions through the constant-region genes, which is
                 consistent with the activation of multiple initiation sites.
                 In contrast, in plasma cell lines, replication of the Igh
                 locus occurs through a triphasic pattern similar to that
                 previously detected in MEL cells. Sequences downstream of the
                 Igh-C alpha gene replicate early in S, while heavy-chain
                 variable (Vh) gene sequences replicate late in S. An
                 approximately 500-kb transition region connecting sequences
                 that replicate early and late is replicated progressively
                 later in S. The formation of the transition region in
                 different cell lines is independent of the sequences
                 encompassed. In B-cell lines that exhibit a
                 triphasic-replication pattern, replication forks progress in
                 one direction through the examined constant-region genes.
                 Timing data and the direction of replication fork movement
                 indicate that replication of the transition region occurs by a
                 single replication fork, as previously described for MEL
                 cells. Associated with the contrasting replication programs
                 are differences in the subnuclear locations of Igh loci. When
                 the entire locus is replicated early in S, the Igh locus is
                 located away from the nuclear periphery, but when Vh gene
                 sequences replicate late and there is a temporal-transition
                 region, the entire Igh locus is located near the nuclear
                 periphery.",

                 proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome

                 Cancer mutations are not distributed uniformly along the human
                 genome. Instead, different human genomic regions vary by up to
                 fivefold in the local density of cancer somatic mutations,
                 posing a fundamental problem for statistical methods used in
                 cancer genomics. Epigenomic organization has been proposed as
                 a major determinant of the cancer mutational landscape.
                 However, both somatic mutagenesis and epigenomic features are
                 highly cell-type-specific. We investigated the distribution of
                 mutations in multiple independent samples of diverse cancer
                 types and compared them to cell-type-specific epigenomic
                 features. Here we show that chromatin accessibility and
                 modification, together with replication timing, explain up to
                 86\% of the variance in mutation rates along cancer genomes.
                 The best predictors of local somatic mutation density are
                 epigenomic features derived from the most likely cell type of
                 origin of the corresponding malignancy. Moreover, we find that
                 cell-of-origin chromatin features are much stronger
                 determinants of cancer mutation profiles than chromatin
                 features of matched cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we show
                 that the cell type of origin of a cancer can be accurately
                 determined based on the distribution of mutations along its
                 genome. Thus, the DNA sequence of a cancer genome encompasses

                 firing of clusters of replicons that duplicate megabase-sized
                 chromosome segments at specific times during S-phase.
                 Cytogenetic studies show that these ``replicon clusters''
                 coalesce as subchromosomal units that persist through multiple
                 cell generations, but the molecular boundaries of such units
                 have remained elusive. Moreover, the extent to which changes
                 in replication timing occur during differentiation and their
                 relationship to transcription changes has not been rigorously
                 investigated. We have constructed high-resolution
                 replication-timing profiles in mouse embryonic stem cells
                 (mESCs) before and after differentiation to neural precursor
                 cells. We demonstrate that chromosomes can be segmented into
                 multimegabase domains of coordinate replication, which we call
                 ``replication domains,'' separated by transition regions whose
                 replication kinetics are consistent with large originless
                 segments. The molecular boundaries of replication domains are
                 remarkably well conserved between distantly related ESC lines
                 and induced pluripotent stem cells. Unexpectedly, ESC
                 differentiation was accompanied by the consolidation of
                 smaller differentially replicating domains into larger
                 coordinately replicated units whose replication time was more
                 aligned to isochore GC content and the density of LINE-1
                 transposable elements, but not gene density.
                 Replication-timing changes were coordinated with transcription
                 changes for weak promoters more than strong promoters, and
                 were accompanied by rearrangements in subnuclear position. We
                 conclude that replication profiles are cell-type specific, and
                 changes in these profiles reveal chromosome segments that
                 undergo large changes in organization during differentiation.
                 Moreover, smaller replication domains and a higher density of
                 timing transition regions that interrupt isochore replication

              These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number
              of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results
              advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in
              several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing
              evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that
              the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts,
              including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that
              extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination
              of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about
              transcription start sites, including their relationship to
              specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin
              accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more
              sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including
              its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional
              regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of
              information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution
              based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has
              yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the

                 been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair
                 and DNA replication. Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is
                 mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase
                 PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results in
                 defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA
                 damage, which has been partially attributed to defects in
                 origin selection and activation. However, these studies were
                 limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and it remains
                 unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the
                 replication program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic,
                 cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the
                 role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA

                 that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin
                 activation throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of
                 PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1 results in the accumulation of
                 DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest. Coincident
                 with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased
                 DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating
                 regions of the Drosophila genome, suggesting that
                 PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is critical for

              undergo amplification in ovarian follicle cells prior to their

              by only 1-2 kb. At least two other regions complementary to ovary
              RNA are located within 5 kb of these genes. During oogenesis, the
              transcribed sequences within each cluster, as well as the spacer
              sequences that separate them, are amplified equally. Sequences
              adjacent to the transcribed regions also replicate differentially

  abstract    = "Our genome contains many G-rich sequences, which have the
                 propensity to fold into stable secondary DNA structures called
                 G4 or G-quadruplex structures. These structures have been
                 implicated in cellular processes such as gene regulation and
                 telomere maintenance. However, G4 sequences are prone to
                 mutations particularly upon replication stress or in the
                 absence of specific helicases. To investigate how G-quadruplex
                 structures are resolved during DNA replication, we developed a
                 model system using ssDNA templates and Xenopus egg extracts
                 that recapitulates eukaryotic G4 replication. Here, we show
                 that G-quadruplex structures form a barrier for DNA
                 replication. Nascent strand synthesis is blocked at one or two
                 nucleotides from the G4. After transient stalling,
                 G-quadruplexes are efficiently unwound and replicated. In
                 contrast, depletion of the FANCJ/BRIP1 helicase causes
                 persistent replication stalling at G-quadruplex structures,
                 demonstrating a vital role for this helicase in resolving
                 these structures. FANCJ performs this function independently
                 of the classical Fanconi anemia pathway. These data provide
                 evidence that the G4 sequence instability in FANCJ(-/-) cells
                 and Fancj/dog1 deficient C. elegans is caused by replication
                 stalling at G-quadruplexes.",

                 formed by certain G-rich nucleic acids, with various
                 biological roles. However, structural features dictating their
                 formation and/or function in vivo are unknown. In S.
                 cerevisiae, the pathological persistency of G4 within the CEB1
                 minisatellite induces its rearrangement during leading-strand
                 replication. We now show that several other G4-forming
                 sequences remain stable. Extensive mutagenesis of the CEB25
                 minisatellite motif reveals that only variants with very short
                 ($\leq$ 4 nt) G4 loops preferentially containing pyrimidine
                 bases trigger genomic instability. Parallel biophysical
                 analyses demonstrate that shortening loop length does not
                 change the monomorphic G4 structure of CEB25 variants but
                 drastically increases its thermal stability, in correlation
                 with the in vivo instability. Finally, bioinformatics analyses
                 reveal that the threat for genomic stability posed by G4
                 bearing short pyrimidine loops is conserved in C. elegans and
                 humans. This work provides a framework explanation for the
                 heterogeneous instability behavior of G4-forming sequences in
                 vivo, highlights the importance of structure thermal
                 stability, and questions the prevailing assumption that G4

                 initiates from multiple origins of replication, and because of
                 this multiplicity, activation of replication origins is likely
                 to be highly coordinated; origins fire at characteristic
                 times, with some origins firing on average earlier
                 (early-firing origins) and others later (late-firing origins)
                 in the S phase of the budding yeast cell cycle. However, the
                 molecular basis for such temporal regulation is poorly
                 understood. RESULTS: We show that origin association of the
                 low-abundance replication proteins Sld3, Sld7, and Cdc45 is
                 the key to determining the temporal order of origin firing.
                 These proteins form a complex and associate with the
                 early-firing origins in G1 phase in a manner that depends on
                 Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), which is essential for the
                 initiation of DNA replication. An increased dosage of Sld3,
                 Sld7, and Cdc45 allows the late-firing origins to fire earlier
                 in S phase. Additionally, an increased dosage of DDK also
                 allows the late-firing origins to fire earlier. CONCLUSIONS:
                 The DDK-dependent limited association between origins and
                 Sld3-Sld7-Cdc45 is a key step for determining the timing of

                 all origins do not fire simultaneously at the beginning of
                 S-phase is not known, but two kinase activities,
                 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK),
                 are continually required throughout the S-phase for all

                 together with the DDK subunit Dbf4 are in low abundance in the

                 consisting of conserved interior $\beta$-hairpins from the two
                 single hexamers create a narrow passageway that tightly fits

                 of the two single hexamers at the double hexamer interface, is
                 flanked by two pairs of gate-forming subunits, MCM2 and MCM5.
                 These unusual features of the twisted and tilted single

                 discrete sites in the interphase nucleus where assemblies of
                 DNA replication enzymes simultaneously elongate the
                 replication forks of 10-100 adjacent replicons (each
                 approximately 100 kbp). Here we review new results and provide
                 alternative interpretations for old results to show that the
                 current paradigm is in need of further development. In
                 particular, many replicons are larger than previously thought
                 - so large that their complete replication takes much longer
                 (several hours) than the measured average time to complete
                 replication at individual foci (45-60 min). In addition to
                 this large heterogeneity in replicon size, it is now apparent
                 that there is also a corresponding heterogeneity in the size
                 and intensity of individual replication foci. An important
                 property of all replication foci is that they are stable
                 structures that persist, with constant dimensions, during all
                 cell cycle stages including mitosis, and therefore likely
                 represent a fundamental unit of chromatin organization. With
                 this in mind, we present a modified model of replication foci
                 in which many of the foci are composed of clusters of small
                 replicons as previously proposed, but the size and number of
                 replicons per focus is extremely heterogeneous, and a
                 significant proportion of foci are composed of single large
                 replicons. We further speculate that very large replicons may
                 extend over two or more individual foci and that this
                 organization may be important in regulating the replication of
                 such large replicons as the cell proceeds through S-phase.",

                 (histone acetyltransferase bound to ORC; MYST2/KAT7) is

                 HBO1 led to a more than 90\% reduction of histone 3 lysine 14
                 (H3K14) acetylation, whereas no reduction of acetylation was
                 detected at other histone residues. The decrease in H3K14
                 acetylation was accompanied by a decrease in expression of the
                 majority of genes studied. However, some genes, in particular
                 genes regulating embryonic patterning, were more severely
                 affected than ``housekeeping'' genes. Development of
                 HBO1-deficient embryos was arrested at the 10-somite stage.
                 Blood vessels, mesenchyme, and somites were disorganized. In

                 mutant embryos, resulting initially in the degeneration of
                 mesenchymal tissues and ultimately in embryonic lethality. In
                 conclusion, the primary role of HBO1 in development is that of
                 a transcriptional activator, which is indispensable for H3K14

                 Chromatin modifications are known to influence the genomic
                 location of origins and the time during S phase that they
                 initiate replication in different cells. However, how
                 chromatin regulates origins in concert with cell
                 differentiation remains poorly understood. Here, we use
                 developmental gene amplification in Drosophila ovarian
                 follicle cells as a model to investigate how chromatin
                 modifiers regulate origins in a developmental context. We find
                 that the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) Chameau (Chm) binds
                 to amplicon origins and is partially required for their
                 function. Depletion of Chm had relatively mild effects on
                 origins during gene amplification and genomic replication
                 compared with previous knockdown of its ortholog HBO1 in human
                 cells, which has severe effects on origin function. We show
                 that another HAT, CBP (Nejire), also binds amplicon origins
                 and is partially required for amplification. Knockdown of Chm
                 and CBP together had a more severe effect on nucleosome
                 acetylation and amplicon origin activity than knockdown of
                 either HAT alone, suggesting that these HATs collaborate in
                 origin regulation. In addition to their local function at the
                 origin, we show that Chm and CBP also globally regulate the
                 developmental transition of follicle cells into the
                 amplification stages of oogenesis. Our results reveal a
                 complexity of origin epigenetic regulation by multiple HATs
                 during development and suggest that chromatin modifiers are a

                 changes in gene expression. We previously proposed that this
                 epigenetic instability arises from G4-induced replication fork
                 stalls disrupting the accurate propagation of chromatin
                 structure through replication. Here, we test this model by
                 showing that a single G4 motif is responsible for the
                 epigenetic instability of the BU-1 locus in REV1-deficient
                 cells, despite its location 3.5 kb from the transcription
                 start site (TSS). The effect of the G4 is dependent on it
                 residing on the leading strand template, but is independent of
                 its in vitro thermal stability. Moving the motif to more than
                 4 kb from the TSS stabilises expression of the gene. However,
                 loss of histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K9/14ac) around
                 the transcription start site correlates with the position of
                 the G4 motif, expression being lost only when the promoter is

                 replicating. GC-rich regions are gene dense and are enriched
                 for active transcription, suggesting a connection between gene
                 regulation and replication timing. Insulator elements can
                 organize independent domains of gene transcription and are
                 suitable candidates for being key regulators of replication
                 timing. We have tested the impact of inserting a strong
                 replication origin flanked by the $\beta$-globin HS4 insulator
                 on the replication timing of naturally late replicating
                 regions in two different avian cell types, DT40 (lymphoid) and

                 Its N-terminal region represents the only homologue of the
                 essential DNA replication initiation factor Sld2 of
                 Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and also participates in the
                 vertebrate initiation of DNA replication. Here, we utilized a
                 random screen to identify N-terminal fragments of human RecQL4
                 that could be stably expressed in and purified from
                 Escherichia coli. Biophysical characterization of these
                 fragments revealed that the Sld2 homologous RecQL4 N-terminal
                 domain carries large intrinsically disordered regions. The
                 N-terminal fragments were sufficient for the strong annealing
                 activity of RecQL4. Moreover, this activity appeared to be the
                 basis for an ATP-independent strand exchange activity. Both
                 activities relied on multiple DNA-binding sites with
                 affinities to single-stranded, double-stranded and
                 Y-structured DNA. Finally, we found a remarkable affinity of
                 the N-terminus for guanine quadruplex (G4) DNA, exceeding the
                 affinities for other DNA structures by at least 60-fold.
                 Together, these findings suggest that the DNA interactions
                 mediated by the N-terminal region of human RecQL4 represent a
                 central function at the replication fork. The presented data
                 may also provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of

                 contrast to the fact that Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORC
                 recognizes the replication origin in a sequence-specific
                 manner, metazoan ORC has not exhibited strict
                 sequence-specificity for DNA binding. Here we report that
                 human ORC binds preferentially to G-quadruplex (G4)-preferable
                 G-rich RNA or single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). We mapped the
                 G-rich RNA-binding domain in the ORC1 subunit, in a region
                 adjacent to its ATPase domain. This domain itself has an
                 ability to preferentially recognize G4-preferable sequences of
                 ssDNA. Furthermore, we found, by structure modeling, that the

                 of AdoMet\_MTase domain of mammalian DNA methyltransferase 1.
                 Therefore, in contrast with the binding to double-stranded
                 DNA, human ORC has an apparent sequence preference with
                 respect to its RNA/ssDNA binding. Interestingly, this
                 specificity coincides with the common signature present in
                 most of the human replication origins. We expect that our

                 accomplished by controlling the assembly of a prereplicative
                 complex (pre-RC) which involves the sequential binding to
                 replication origins of the origin recognition complex (ORC),
                 Cdc6/Cdc18, Cdt1, and the minichromosome maintenance complex

                 is identical to the ORC1-interacting protein termed HBO1. HBO1
                 belongs to the MYST family, characterized by a highly
                 conserved C2HC zinc finger and a putative histone

                 interaction between MCM2 and HBO1 in vitro and in vivo. An
                 N-terminal domain of MCM2 is necessary for binding to HBO1,
                 and a C2HC zinc finger of HBO1 is essential for binding to

                 isolate an allele of MCM2 that is defective for interaction

                 finger. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that
                 the interaction between MCM2 and HBO1 is direct and mediated

                 mechanisms coordinating the activation of about [Formula: see
                 text] predicted origins remain poorly understood, partly due
                 to the intrinsic rarity of replication bubbles, making it
                 difficult to purify short nascent strands (SNS). The precise
                 identification of origins based on the high-throughput
                 sequencing of SNS constitutes a new methodological challenge.
                 We propose a new statistical method with a controlled
                 resolution, adapted to the detection of replication origins
                 from SNS data. We detected an average of 80,000 replication
                 origins in different cell lines. To evaluate the consistency
                 between different protocols, we compared SNS detections with
                 bubble trapping detections. This comparison demonstrated a
                 good agreement between genome-wide methods, with 65\% of
                 SNS-detected origins validated by bubble trapping, and 44\% of
                 bubble trapping origins validated by SNS origins, when
                 compared at the same resolution. We investigated the interplay
                 between the spatial and the temporal programs of replication
                 at fine scales. We show that most of the origins detected in
                 regions replicated in early S phase are shared by all the cell
                 lines investigated whereas cell-type-specific origins tend to
                 be replicated in late S phase. We shed a new light on the key
                 role of CpG islands, by showing that 80\% of the origins
                 associated with CGIs are constitutive. Our results further
                 show that at least 76\% of CGIs are origins of replication.
                 The analysis of associations with chromatin marks at different
                 timing of cell division revealed new potential epigenetic
                 regulators driving the spatiotemporal activity of replication

                 identification of endogenous genes that are parentally
                 imprinted in the mouse. Little is known about the precise
                 mechanisms involved in the process, but structural differences
                 between the two alleles must somehow provide cis-acting
                 signals for directing parental-specific transcription.
                 Cell-cycle replication time is one parameter that has been
                 shown to be associated with both tissue-specific gene
                 expression and the allele-specific transcription patterns of
                 the X chromosomes in female cells. For this reason we have
                 examined the replication timing patterns for the chromosomal
                 regions containing the imprinted genes Igf2, Igf2r, H19 and
                 Snrpn in the mouse. At all of these sites, and their
                 corresponding positions in the human genome, the two
                 homologous alleles replicate asynchronously and it is always
                 the paternal allele that is early-replicating. Thus imprinted
                 genes appear to be embedded in large DNA domains with

                 origins, we identified them genome-wide and at unprecedented
                 high-resolution in mouse ES cells. This allowed initiation
                 sites (IS) and initiation zones (IZ) to be differentiated. We
                 then characterized their genetic signatures and organization
                 and integrated these data with 43 chromatin marks and factors.
                 Our results reveal that replication origins can be grouped
                 into three main classes with distinct organization, chromatin
                 environment, and sequence motifs. Class 1 contains relatively
                 isolated, low-efficiency origins that are poor in epigenetic
                 marks and are enriched in an asymmetric AC repeat at the
                 initiation site. Late origins are mainly found in this class.
                 Class 2 origins are particularly rich in enhancer elements.
                 Class 3 origins are the most efficient and are associated with
                 open chromatin and polycomb protein-enriched regions. The
                 presence of Origin G-rich Repeated elements (OGRE) potentially
                 forming G-quadruplexes (G4) was confirmed at most origins.
                 These coincide with nucleosome-depleted regions located
                 upstream of the initiation sites, which are associated with a
                 labile nucleosome containing H3K64ac. These data demonstrate
                 that specific chromatin landscapes and combinations of
                 specific signatures regulate origin localization. They explain
                 the frequently observed links between DNA replication and
                 transcription. They also emphasize the plasticity of metazoan
                 replication origins and suggest that in multicellular
                 eukaryotes, the combination of distinct genetic features and
                 chromatin configurations act in synergy to define and adapt
                 the origin profile.",

                 initiated from virtually all origins after transient exposure
                 to hydroxyurea (HU), an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase.
                 Here we sought to determine whether all replication forks
                 containing single-stranded DNA gaps have equal probability of
                 producing double-strand breaks (DSBs) when cells attempt to
                 recover from HU exposure. We devised a new methodology,
                 Break-seq, that combines our previously described DSB labeling
                 with next generation sequencing to map chromosome breaks with
                 improved sensitivity and resolution. We show that DSBs
                 preferentially occur at genes transcriptionally induced by HU.
                 Notably, different subsets of the HU-induced genes produced
                 DSBs in MEC1 and mec1 cells as replication forks traversed a
                 greater distance in MEC1 cells than in mec1 cells during
                 recovery from HU. Specifically, while MEC1 cells exhibited
                 chromosome breakage at stress-response transcription factors,
                 mec1 cells predominantly suffered chromosome breakage at
                 transporter genes, many of which are the substrates of those
                 transcription factors. We propose that HU-induced chromosome
                 fragility arises at higher frequency near HU-induced genes as
                 a result of destabilized replication forks encountering
                 transcription factor binding and/or the act of transcription.
                 We further propose that replication inhibitors can induce
                 unscheduled encounters between replication and transcription

                 to sustain genomic integrity. In eukaryotes, the
                 heterohexameric origin recognition complex (ORC) is essential
                 for coordinating replication onset. Here we describe the
                 crystal structure of Drosophila ORC at 3.5 {\AA} resolution,
                 showing that the 270 kilodalton initiator core complex
                 comprises a two-layered notched ring in which a collar of
                 winged-helix domains from the Orc1-5 subunits sits atop a
                 layer of AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular
                 activities) folds. Although canonical inter-AAA+ domain
                 interactions exist between four of the six ORC subunits,
                 unanticipated features are also evident. These include highly
                 interdigitated domain-swapping interactions between the
                 winged-helix folds and AAA+ modules of neighbouring protomers,
                 and a quasi-spiral arrangement of DNA binding elements that
                 circumnavigate an approximately 20 {\AA} wide channel in the
                 centre of the complex. Comparative analyses indicate that ORC
                 encircles DNA, using its winged-helix domain face to engage
                 the mini-chromosome maintenance 2-7 (MCM2-7) complex during
                 replicative helicase loading; however, an observed
                 out-of-plane rotation of more than 90° for the Orc1 AAA+
                 domain disrupts interactions with catalytic amino acids in
                 Orc4, narrowing and sealing off entry into the central
                 channel. Prima facie, our data indicate that Drosophila ORC

                 this cell line. We find that early-firing origins, which
                 represent ∼32\% of all origins, overwhelmingly represent
                 zones, associate only marginally with active transcription
                 units, are localized within large domains of open chromatin,
                 and are significantly associated with DNase I
                 hypersensitivity. Origin ``density'' falls from early- to
                 mid-S-phase, but rises again in late S-phase to levels only
                 17\% lower than in early S-phase. Unexpectedly, late origin
                 density calculated on the 1-Mb scale increases as a function
                 of increasing chromatin compaction. Furthermore, the median
                 efficiency of origins in late-replicating, heterochromatic
                 domains is only 25\% lower than in early-replicating

                 late-firing origins must be regulated by quintessentially

                 overrepresentation at the 5' and 3' of Ori sites,
                 respectively. Repeated GC-rich elements were detected, which
                 are good predictors of Oris, suggesting that common sequence
                 features are part of metazoan Oris. In the heterochromatic
                 chromosome 4 of Drosophila, Oris correlated with HP1 binding
                 sites. At the chromosome level, regions rich in Oris are early
                 replicating, whereas Ori-poor regions are late replicating.
                 The genome-wide analysis was coupled with a DNA combing
                 analysis to unravel the organization of Oris. The results
                 indicate that Oris are in a large excess, but their activation
                 does not occur at random. They are organized in groups of
                 site-specific but flexible origins that define replicons,
                 where a single origin is activated in each replicon. This
                 organization provides both site specificity and Ori firing
                 flexibility in each replicon, allowing possible adaptation to
                 environmental cues and cell fates.",

                 spaced genomic segments in a 1 kb size fraction of nascent

                 more frequent than upstream of the gene. This primary

                 approach to identify preferential sites of DNA replication
                 initiation at 0.4\% of the mouse genome with detailed
                 molecular analysis at distinct classes of ORIs according to
                 their location relative to the genes. Our study reveals that
                 85\% of the replication initiation sites in mouse embryonic
                 stem (ES) cells are associated with transcriptional units.
                 Nearly half of the identified ORIs map at promoter regions

                 promoter density, reflecting the coordinated organisation of

                 analysis of ORI activity showed that CpG island promoter-ORIs

                 This association implies that transcription initiation early

                 chromatin-mediated transcriptional repression. We have tested
                 the possibility that SWI/SNF might also play a role in DNA
                 replication. A mitotic minichromosome stability assay was used

                 autonomous replication sequences (ARSs) in the presence and
                 absence of SWI/SNF. The stability of minichromosomes that
                 contain ARS1, ARS309 or ARS307 is not altered by lack of
                 SWI/SNF, whereas the functioning of ARS121 is crippled when
                 SWI/SNF is inactivated. The SWI/SNF dependence of ARS121 does
                 not require the replication enhancer factor, ABF1, and thus,
                 it appears to be a property of a minimal ARS121 origin.
                 Likewise, a minimal derivative of ARS1 that lacks the ABF1
                 replication enhancer acquires SWI/SNF dependence. Replacing
                 the ABF1 binding site at ARS1 with a binding site for the
                 LexA-GAL4 chimeric activator also creates a SWI/SNF-dependent

                 initiates stochastically, primarily within non-transcribed,
                 broad (up to 150 kb) zones that often abut transcribed genes,
                 and terminates dispersively between them. Replication fork
                 progression is significantly co-oriented with the
                 transcription. Initiation and termination zones are frequently
                 contiguous, sometimes separated by regions of unidirectional
                 replication. Initiation zones are enriched in open chromatin
                 and enhancer marks, even when not flanked by genes, and often
                 border 'topologically associating domains' (TADs). Initiation
                 zones are enriched in origin recognition complex (ORC)-binding
                 sites and better align to origins previously mapped using
                 bubble-trap than $\lambda$-exonuclease. This novel panorama of

                 exist in many organisms and are particularly prevalent within
                 the mammalian placenta [1], where they can generate more than
                 900 copies of the genome [2]. Polyploidy is thought to be an
                 efficient method of increasing the content of the genome by
                 avoiding the costly and slow process of cytokinesis [1, 3, 4].
                 Polyploidy can also affect gene regulation by amplifying a
                 subset of genomic regions required for specific cellular
                 function [1, 3, 4]. This mechanism is found in the fruit fly
                 Drosophila melanogaster, where polyploid ovarian follicle
                 cells amplify genomic regions containing chorion genes, which
                 facilitate secretion of eggshell proteins [5]. Here, we report
                 that genomic amplification also occurs in mammals at selective
                 regions of the genome in parietal trophoblast giant cells
                 (p-TGCs) of the mouse placenta. Using whole-genome sequencing
                 (WGS) and digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) of mouse p-TGCs, we
                 identified five amplified regions, each containing a gene
                 family known to be involved in mammalian placentation: the
                 prolactins (two clusters), serpins, cathepsins, and the

                 of any discernible simple motif. Although no clear sequence
                 motif emerged, we were able to use machine learning approaches
                 to accurately discriminate between ORC-associated sequences
                 and ORC-free sequences based solely on primary sequence. The
                 complex sequence features that define ORC binding sites are

                 likely represent a preferred nucleosomal landscape for ORC

                 sequences are enriched for the histone variant, H3.3, often at

                 The density of ORC binding along the chromosome is reflected
                 in the time at which a sequence replicates, with early
                 replicating sequences having a high density of ORC binding.
                 Finally, we found a high concordance between sites of ORC

              (H4K20me3) is associated with multiple cancers, but its role in
              breast tumors is unclear. In addition, the pathological effects
              of global reduction in H4K20me3 remain mostly unknown. Therefore,
              a major goal of this study was to elucidate the global H4K20me3
              level in breast cancer tissue and investigate its pathological
              functions. METHODS: Levels of H4K20me3 and an associated histone
              modification, H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), were
              evaluated by immunohistochemistry in a series of breast cancer
              tissues. Univariate and multivariate clinicopathological and
              survival analyses were performed. We also examined the effect of
              overexpression or knockdown of the histone H4K20
              methyltransferases, SUV420H1 and SUV420H2, on cancer-cell
              invasion activity in vitro. RESULTS: H4K20me3, but not H3K9me3,
              was clearly reduced in breast cancer tissue. A reduced level of
              H4K20me3 was correlated with several aspects of
              clinicopathological status, including luminal subtypes, but not
              with HER2 expression. Multivariate analysis showed that reduced
              levels of H4K20me3 independently associated with lower
              disease-free survival. Moreover, ectopic expression of SUV420H1
              and SUV420H2 in breast cancer cells suppressed cell invasiveness,
              whereas knockdown of SUV420H2 activated normal mammary
              epithelial-cell invasion in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: H4K20me3 was
              reduced in cancerous regions of breast-tumor tissue, as in other
              types of tumor. Reduced H4K20me3 level can be used as an
              independent marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients.
              Most importantly, this study suggests that a reduced level of
              H4K20me3 increases the invasiveness of breast cancer cells in a
              HER2-independent manner.",

                 plays a novel role in regulating cell cycle by suppressing DNA
                 replication through histone binding. First, the distribution
                 of SET8 is strongly cell cycle-dependent. SET8 was
                 concentrated in the nucleus during G(1) and G(2) phases, and
                 was excluded from the nucleus during S phase. Second, at
                 G(1)/S transition, SET8 was degraded through ubiquitination
                 via SCF/Skp2. Third, it was evident that the SET8 binds to the
                 H4 N-terminal tail (H4NT) and blocks the acetylation of lysine
                 residues K5, K8 and K12 of histone H4 during G(1). Such a
                 blockage can hinder DNA replication. Fourth, SET8 binds to
                 hypoacetylated but not hyperacetylated H4NT. Finally,

                 suppress DNA replication and arrest the cell cycle before the

                 SET8 is one of the methyltransferases identified to be
                 specific for this modification. In this study, the minimal
                 active SET domain of SET8 has been mapped to the region of
                 amino acids 195-352. This region completely retains the same
                 methylation activity and substrate specificity as the
                 full-length SET8. The SET domain recognizes a stretch of
                 specific amino acid sequence around lysine 20 of H4 for its
                 methylation activity. Methylation assays with N terminus
                 mutants of H4 that contain deletions and single alanine or
                 glutamine substitutions of charged residues revealed that SET8
                 requires the sequence RHRK20VLRDN for methylation at lysine

                 sequence to alanine or glutamine abolished or greatly

                 20 by the SET domain. Mass spectrometric analysis of
                 synthesized H4 N-terminal peptides modified by SET8 showed
                 that SET8 selectively mono-methylates lysine 20 of H4. Taken
                 together, our results suggested that the coordination between
                 the amino acid sequence RHRK20VLRDN and the SET domain of SET8

                 methyltransferase that dimethylates approximately 90\% and
                 trimethylates less than 5\% of total H4 at lysine 20 in S2
                 cells. Trimethylation, but not dimethylation, is reduced in
                 Drosophila larvae lacking HP1, suggesting that an interaction
                 with HP1 regulates the product specificity of Suv4-20 and
                 enrichment of trimethyllysine 20 within heterochromatin.
                 Similar to the Drosophila enzyme, human Suv4-20h1/h2 enzymes
                 generate di- and trimethyllysine 20. PR-Set7 and Suv4-20 are
                 both required for normal levels of methylation, suggesting
                 they have non-redundant functions. Alterations in the level of
                 lysine 20 methylation following knock-down or overexpression
                 of Suv4-20 did not affect lysine 16 acetylation, revealing
                 that these two modifications are not competitive in vivo.
                 Depletion of Suv4-20h1/h2 in HeLa cells impaired the formation
                 of 53BP1 foci, suggesting dimethyllysine 20 is required for a
                 proper DNA damage response. Collectively, the data indicate
                 that Suv4-20 generates nearly ubiquitous dimethylation that
                 facilitates the DNA damage response and selective
                 trimethylation that is involved in heterochromatin formation.",

                 treatment, which induces replication stress and
                 replication-associated double-strand breaks. To clarify the
                 involvement of DNA-PKcs in this process, we analyzed DNA-PKcs
                 phosphorylation in response to UV irradiation, which causes

                 at S2056, distinct from that induced by IR. UV-induced
                 DNA-PKcs phosphorylation occurs specifically only in

                 associates with ATR in vivo and is phosphorylated by ATR in
                 vitro, suggesting that DNA-PKcs could be the direct downstream
                 target of ATR. Taken together, these results strongly suggest
                 that DNA-PKcs is required for the cellular response to

                 represent dynamic intermediates at the same chromatin sites.
                 Here, we have used recently developed antibodies that are
                 highly specific for mono-, di-, and trimethylated lysine 9 of
                 histone H3 (MeK9H3) to examine the subnuclear localization and
                 replication timing of chromatin containing these epigenetic
                 marks in mammalian cells. Me1K9H3 was largely restricted to
                 early replicating, small punctate domains in the nuclear
                 interior. Me2K9H3 was the predominant MeK9 epitope at the
                 nuclear and nucleolar periphery and colocalized with sites of
                 DNA synthesis primarily in mid-S phase. Me3K9H3 decorated
                 late-replicating pericentric heterochromatin in mouse cells
                 and sites of DAPI-dense intranuclear heterochromatin in human
                 and hamster cells that replicated throughout S phase.
                 Disruption of the Suv39h1,2 or G9a methyltransferases in
                 murine embryonic stem cells resulted in a redistribution of
                 methyl epitopes, but did not alter the overall spatiotemporal
                 replication program. These results demonstrate that mono-,
                 di-, and trimethylated states of K9H3 largely occupy distinct

                 cell-free system to initiate replication within G1-phase
                 nuclei, we demonstrate that chromocenters acquire the property

                 program. HP1 dissociated during mitosis but rebound before the
                 establishment of late replication, and removing HP1 from
                 chromocenters by competition with Me3K9H3 peptides did not

                 level of large chromosomal domains (0.5-5 megabases in
                 mammals) within which replicons are activated relatively
                 synchronously. These domains replicate in a specific temporal
                 order during S-phase and our genome-wide analyses of
                 replication timing have demonstrated that this temporal order
                 of domain replication is a stable property of specific cell
                 types. RESULTS: We have developed ReplicationDomain
                 http://www.replicationdomain.org as a web-based database for
                 analysis of genome-wide replication timing maps (replication
                 profiles) from various cell lines and species. This database
                 also provides comparative information of transcriptional
                 expression and is configured to display any genome-wide
                 property (for instance, ChIP-Chip or ChIP-Seq data) via an
                 interactive web interface. Our published microarray data sets
                 are publicly available. Users may graphically display these
                 data sets for a selected genomic region and download the data
                 displayed as text files, or alternatively, download complete
                 genome-wide data sets. Furthermore, we have implemented a user
                 registration system that allows registered users to upload
                 their own data sets. Upon uploading, registered users may
                 choose to: (1) view their data sets privately without sharing;
                 (2) share with other registered users; or (3) make their
                 published or ``in press'' data sets publicly available, which
                 can fulfill journal and funding agencies' requirements for
                 data sharing. CONCLUSION: ReplicationDomain is a novel and
                 powerful tool to facilitate the comparative visualization of
                 replication timing in various cell types as well as other
                 genome-wide chromatin features and is considerably faster and
                 more convenient than existing browsers when viewing
                 multi-megabase segments of chromosomes. Furthermore, the data
                 upload function with the option of private viewing or sharing

                 of replication origins, which consists of assembling a
                 pre-replication complex (pre-RC) on origins during late M- and
                 G1-phases. In metazoans, functional replication origins do not
                 show defined DNA consensus sequences, thus evoking the
                 involvement of chromatin determinants in the selection of
                 these origins. Here, we show that the onset of licensing in
                 mammalian cells coincides with an increase in histone H4 Lys
                 20 monomethylation (H4K20me1) at replication origins by the
                 methyltransferase PR-Set7 (also known as Set8 or KMT5A).
                 Indeed, tethering PR-Set7 methylase activity to a specific
                 genomic locus promotes the loading of pre-RC proteins on

                 contributes to the disappearance of H4K20me1 at origins and

                 In the case of H3-Lys(4), H3-Lys(9), H3-Lys(27), and
                 H4-Lys(20), the degree of methylation was variable from the
                 mono- to the di- or trimethylated state, each of which was

                 commitment, associated with a stable form of gene silencing
                 that is difficult to reverse. Here, we discuss results
                 demonstrating that these domains are among the least sensitive
                 regions in the genome to global digestion by either MNase or
                 restriction enzymes. This inaccessible chromatin state
                 persists whether these regions are in their physically
                 distended early replicating or compact late replicating
                 configuration, despite dramatic changes in 3D chromatin
                 folding and long-range chromatin interactions, and despite
                 large changes in transcriptional activity. This contrasts with
                 the strong correlation between early replication,
                 accessibility, transcriptional activity and open chromatin
                 configuration that is observed genome-wide. We put these

                 domains. This suggests that switching domains are a type of
                 late replicating domain within which both replication timing
                 and transcription are subject to unique or additional layers
                 of control not experienced by the bulk of the genome. We

                 establish this code and its function in transcription were
                 unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that H3K9
                 monomethylation is dependent upon the PR-Set7 H4K20
                 monomethyltransferase but independent of its catalytic
                 function, indicating that PR-Set7 recruits an H3K9
                 monomethyltransferase to establish the trans-tail histone
                 code. We determined that this histone code is involved in a
                 transcriptional regulatory pathway in vivo whereby
                 monomethylated H4K20 binds the L3MBTL1 repressor protein to

                 newly described repression pathway is required for regulating
                 proper megakaryopoiesis and suggests that it is likely to
                 function similarly in other multipotent cell types to regulate

                 show that Drosophila ATM function is essential for normal
                 adult development. Extensive, inappropriate apoptosis occurs
                 in proliferating atm mutant tissues, and in clonally derived
                 atm mutant embryos, frequent mitotic defects were seen. At a
                 cellular level, spontaneous telomere fusions and other
                 chromosomal abnormalities are common in atm larval
                 neuroblasts, suggesting a conserved and essential role for
                 dATM in the maintenance of normal telomeres and chromosome
                 stability. Evidence from other systems supports the idea that

                 Recently, lysine methylation has been observed on nonhistone
                 proteins, suggesting broad cellular roles for the enzymes
                 generating and removing methyl moieties. Here we report that
                 the lysine methyltransferase enzyme SET8/PR-Set7 regulates the

                 monomethylates p53 at lysine 382 (p53K382me1). This
                 methylation event robustly suppresses p53-mediated
                 transcription activation of highly responsive target genes but
                 has little influence on weak targets. Further, depletion of
                 SET8 augments the proapoptotic and checkpoint activation
                 functions of p53, and accordingly, SET8 expression is
                 downregulated upon DNA damage. Together, our study identifies
                 SET8 as a p53-modifying enzyme, identifies p53K382me1 as a
                 regulatory posttranslational modification of p53, and begins
                 to dissect how methylation may contribute to a dynamic

                 cells with mutations within two separate segments of the Mcm4
                 NSD. The proximal segment of the NSD residing next to the
                 DDK-docking domain mediates repression of late-origin firing
                 by checkpoint signals because in its absence late origins
                 become active despite an elevated DNA damage-checkpoint
                 response. In contrast, the distal segment of the NSD at the N
                 terminus plays no role in the temporal pattern of origin
                 firing but has a strong influence on replication fork
                 progression and on checkpoint signaling. Both fork progression
                 and checkpoint response are regulated by the phosphorylation
                 of the canonical CDK sites at the distal NSD. Together, our
                 data suggest that the eukaryotic MCM helicase contains an
                 intrinsic regulatory domain that integrates multiple signals
                 to coordinate origin activation and replication fork
                 progression under stress conditions.",

                 this process has been inherently difficult to study on a
                 genome-wide level in untransformed differentiated metazoan
                 cells. To determine how metazoan DNA replication can be
                 repressed, we examined regions selectively under-replicated in
                 Drosophila polytene salivary glands, and found they are
                 transcriptionally silent and enriched for the repressive
                 H3K27me3 mark. In the first genome-wide analysis of binding of
                 the origin recognition complex (ORC) in a differentiated
                 metazoan tissue, we find that ORC binding is dramatically
                 reduced within these large domains, suggesting reduced
                 initiation as one mechanism leading to under-replication.
                 Inhibition of replication fork progression by the chromatin
                 protein SUUR is an additional repression mechanism to reduce
                 copy number. Although repressive histone marks are removed
                 when SUUR is mutated and copy number restored, neither
                 transcription nor ORC binding is reinstated. Tethering of the
                 SUUR protein to a specific site is insufficient to block
                 replication, however. These results establish that
                 developmental control of DNA replication, at both the

                 We have identified a highly conserved, leucine-rich repeats

                 detectable in mouse kidneys, testes, ovaries and heart, in

                 testes, corpus luteum cells of ovaries, and cardiac muscle

                 S-phase-promoting kinase (SPK) activity at discrete origins
                 and the simultaneous function of many replicons. DNA damage
                 prevents origin firing through the ATM- and ATR-dependent
                 inhibition of Cdk2 and Cdc7 SPKs. Here, we establish that
                 modulation of ATM- and ATR-signalling pathways controls origin

                 with caffeine or specific neutralizing antibodies, or
                 upregulation of Cdk2 or Cdc7, promoted rapid and synchronous

                 depletion significantly reduces PR-Set7 chromatin levels,

                 and transcription-mediated stress during rapid cell division.
                 Surprisingly, H2AX itself, prior to phosphorylation, was
                 specifically located at these endogenous hotspots. This
                 phenomenon was only observed in dividing cancer cells but not
                 in resting cells. Endogenous H2AX was concentrated on the
                 transcription start site of actively transcribed genes but was
                 irrelevant to pausing of RNA polymerase II (pol II), which
                 precisely coincided with gamma-H2AX of endogenous origin.
                 gamma-H2AX enrichment upon irradiation also coincided with
                 actively transcribed regions, but unlike endogenous
                 gamma-H2AX, it extended into the gene body and was not
                 specifically concentrated on the pausing site of pol II.
                 Sub-telomeres were less responsive to external DNA damage than
                 to endogenous stress. Our findings provide insight into DNA

                 Among the 13 identified FA gene products only one, the DNA
                 translocase FANCM, has homologues in lower organisms,
                 suggesting a conserved function in DNA metabolism. However, a
                 precise role for FANCM in DNA repair remains elusive. Here, we
                 show a novel function for FANCM that is distinct from its role
                 in the FA pathway: promoting replication fork restart and
                 simultaneously limiting the accumulation of RPA-ssDNA. We show
                 that in DT40 cells this process is controlled by ATR and PLK1,
                 and that in the absence of FANCM, stalled replication forks
                 are unable to resume DNA synthesis and genome duplication is
                 ensured by excess origin firing. Unexpectedly, we also uncover
                 an early role for FANCM in ATR-mediated checkpoint signalling

                 trimethylation has emerged as a hallmark of pericentric
                 heterochromatin in mammals. Here we show that H4-K20
                 trimethylation is also focally enriched at pericentric
                 heterochromatin. Intriguingly, H3-K9 trimethylation by the
                 Suv39h HMTases is required for the induction of H4-K20
                 trimethylation, although the H4 Lys 20 position is not an
                 intrinsic substrate for these enzymes. By using a candidate
                 approach, we identified Suv4-20h1 and Suv4-20h2 as two novel
                 SET domain HMTases that localize to pericentric

                 bodies (NBs) is a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic cells. How
                 NBs initially assemble and ultimately affect gene expression
                 remains unresolved. The histone locus body (HLB) contains
                 factors necessary for replication-coupled histone messenger
                 RNA transcription and processing and associates with histone
                 gene clusters. Using a transgenic assay for ectopic Drosophila

                 transcription from, the divergently transcribed H3-H4 genes
                 nucleates HLB formation and activates other histone genes in

                 mutant embryos with the histone locus deleted. We conclude

                 stochastic interactions of individual components that localize

                 terminate in a conserved stem-loop structure rather than a
                 polyA tail. Formation of this unique mRNA 3' end requires
                 Stem-loop Binding Protein (SLBP), which directly binds histone
                 pre-mRNA and stimulates 3' end processing. The 3' end
                 stem-loop is necessary for all aspects of histone mRNA
                 metabolism, including replication coupling, but its importance
                 to organism fitness and genome maintenance in vivo have not
                 been characterized. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In
                 Drosophila, disruption of the Slbp gene prevents normal
                 histone pre-mRNA processing and causes histone pre-mRNAs to
                 utilize the canonical 3' end processing pathway, resulting in
                 polyadenylated histone mRNAs that are no longer properly
                 regulated. Here we show that Slbp mutants display genomic
                 instability, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), increased
                 presence of chromosome breaks, tetraploidy, and changes in
                 position effect variegation (PEV). During imaginal disc
                 growth, Slbp mutant cells show defects in S phase and
                 proliferate more slowly than control cells.
                 CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data are consistent with a
                 model in which changing the 3' end of histone mRNA disrupts
                 normal replication-coupled histone mRNA biosynthesis and
                 alters chromatin assembly, resulting in genomic instability,
                 inhibition of cell proliferation, and impaired development.",

                 RNA and use it to initiate an RNA silencing response, however,
                 the mechanism for this uptake is ill-defined. Here, we
                 identify the pathway for dsRNA uptake in Drosophila
                 melanogaster S2 cells. Biochemical and cell biological
                 analyses, and a genome-wide screen for components of the
                 dsRNA-uptake machinery, indicated that dsRNA is taken up by an
                 active process involving receptor-mediated endocytosis.
                 Pharmacological inhibition of endocytic pathways disrupted
                 exogenous dsRNA entry and the induction of gene silencing.
                 This dsRNA uptake mechanism seems to be evolutionarily
                 conserved, as knockdown of orthologues in Caenorhabditis
                 elegans inactivated the RNA interference response in worms.
                 Thus, this entry pathway is required for systemic RNA
                 silencing in whole organisms. In Drosophila cells,
                 pharmacological evidence suggests that dsRNA entry is mediated
                 by pattern-recognition receptors. The possible role of these
                 receptors in dsRNA entry may link RNA interference (RNAi)

                 whose mutations are known as a risk factor for Fanconi anemia

                 FANCJ and found that reagents that cause DSB or replication
                 fork stalling induce FANCJ hyperphosphorylation. In
                 particular, camptothecin (CPT) induced rapid and efficient
                 FANCJ hyperphosphorylation that was largely dependent on
                 TopBP1 and ATM-Rad3 related (ATR) kinase. Furthermore, DNA end

                 required for hyperphosphorylation. Interestingly, upon CPT
                 treatment, a dramatic increase in the FANCJ-TopBP1 complex was
                 observed, and this increase was not alleviated even when
                 ATR-dependent hyperphosphorylation was suppressed. These
                 results suggest that FANCJ function may be modulated by
                 hyperphosphorylation in a DNA end resection- and ATR-dependent

  abstract    = "In human cells, appropriate monomethylation of histone H4
                 lysine 20 by PrSet7 (also known as SET8 and SETD7) is
                 important for the correct transcription of specific genes and
                 timely progression through the cell cycle. Over-methylation
                 appears to be prevented through the interaction of PrSet7 with
                 proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which targets
                 PrSet7 for destruction through the pathway mediated by CRL4(C)
                 (dt2) (the cullin ring finger ligase-4 complex containing
                 Cdt2). However, the factors involved in positive regulation of
                 PrSet7 histone methylation remain undefined. Here, we present
                 biochemical and genetic evidence for a previously undocumented
                 interaction between Drosophila PrSet7 (dPrSet7) and DNA
                 polymerase alpha in Drosophila. Depletion of the polymerase
                 reduces H4K20 monomethylation suggesting that it is required
                 for dPrSet7 histone methylation activity. We also show that
                 the interaction between PCNA and PrSet7 is conserved in
                 Drosophila, but is only detectable in chromatin fractions.
                 Consistent with this, S2 cells show a significant loss of
                 chromatin-bound dPrSet7 protein as S phase progresses. Based
                 on these data we suggest that interaction with the DNA
                 polymerase represents an important route for stimulation of
                 PrSet7 histone methylase activity that is mediated by allowing
                 loading of dPrSet7 onto chromatin or its subsequent
                 activation.",

                 stem cells, stages of cellular differentiation, and cancer
                 subtypes. Existing methods focus on local chromatin features
                 such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that require
                 extensive analysis for genome-wide coverage. Replication
                 timing has emerged as a highly stable cell type-specific
                 epigenetic feature that is regulated at the megabase-level and
                 is easily and comprehensively analyzed genome-wide. Here, we
                 describe a cell classification method using 67 individual
                 replication profiles from 34 mouse and human cell lines and
                 stem cell-derived tissues, including new data for mesendoderm,
                 definitive endoderm, mesoderm and smooth muscle. Using a
                 Monte-Carlo approach for selecting features of replication
                 profiles conserved in each cell type, we identify
                 ``replication timing fingerprints'' unique to each cell type
                 and apply a k nearest neighbor approach to predict known and
                 unknown cell types. Our method correctly classifies 67/67
                 independent replication-timing profiles, including those
                 derived from closely related intermediate stages. We also
                 apply this method to derive fingerprints for pluripotency in
                 human and mouse cells. Interestingly, the mouse pluripotency
                 fingerprint overlaps almost completely with previously
                 identified genomic segments that switch from early to late
                 replication as pluripotency is lost. Thereafter, replication
                 timing and transcription within these regions become difficult
                 to reprogram back to pluripotency, suggesting these regions
                 highlight an epigenetic barrier to reprogramming. In addition,
                 the major histone cluster Hist1 consistently becomes later
                 replicating in committed cell types, and several histone H1
                 genes in this cluster are downregulated during
                 differentiation, suggesting a possible instrument for the
                 chromatin compaction observed during differentiation. Finally,
                 we demonstrate that unknown samples can be classified
                 independently using site-specific PCR against fingerprint
                 regions. In sum, replication fingerprints provide a
                 comprehensive means for cell characterization and are a
                 promising tool for identifying regions with cell type-specific

                 timing and their relationship to epigenetic properties, we
                 profiled replication timing genome-wide in four human
                 embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines, hESC-derived neural
                 precursor cells (NPCs), lymphoblastoid cells, and two human
                 induced pluripotent stem cell lines (hiPSCs), and compared
                 them with related mouse cell types. Results confirm the
                 conservation of coordinately replicated megabase-sized
                 ``replication domains'' punctuated by origin-suppressed
                 regions. Differentiation-induced replication timing changes in
                 both species occur in 400- to 800-kb units and are similarly
                 coordinated with transcription changes. A surprising degree of
                 cell-type-specific conservation in replication timing was
                 observed across regions of conserved synteny, despite
                 considerable species variation in the alignment of replication
                 timing to isochore GC/LINE-1 content. Notably, hESC
                 replication timing profiles were significantly more aligned to
                 mouse epiblast-derived stem cells (mEpiSCs) than to mouse
                 ESCs. Comparison with epigenetic marks revealed a signature of
                 chromatin modifications at the boundaries of early replicating
                 domains and a remarkably strong link between replication
                 timing and spatial proximity of chromatin as measured by Hi-C
                 analysis. Thus, early and late initiation of replication
                 occurs in spatially separate nuclear compartments, but rarely
                 within the intervening chromatin. Moreover, cell-type-specific
                 conservation of the replication program implies conserved
                 developmental changes in spatial organization of chromatin.
                 Together, our results reveal evolutionarily conserved aspects
                 of developmentally regulated replication programs in mammals,
                 demonstrate the power of replication profiling to distinguish
                 closely related cell types, and strongly support the

                 pediatric leukemias from 17 patients and three cell lines, as
                 well as normal B and T cells. Nonleukemic EBV-transformed
                 lymphoblastoid cell lines displayed highly stable
                 replication-timing profiles that were more similar to normal T
                 cells than to leukemias. Leukemias were more similar to each
                 other than to B and T cells but were considerably more
                 heterogeneous than nonleukemic controls. Some differences were
                 patient specific, while others were found in all leukemic
                 samples, potentially representing early epigenetic events.
                 Differences encompassed large segments of chromosomes and
                 included genes implicated in other types of cancer.
                 Remarkably, differences that distinguished leukemias aligned
                 in register to the boundaries of developmentally regulated
                 replication-timing domains that distinguish normal cell types.
                 Most changes did not coincide with copy-number variation or
                 translocations. However, many of the changes that were
                 associated with translocations in some leukemias were also

                 being an integral part of the nucleosomes placed at specific
                 regions of the genome. Telomeres cap natural ends of
                 chromosomes to prevent their recognition as double-strand
                 breaks. At yeast telomeres, H2A.Z prevents the spreading of
                 silent chromatin into proximal euchromatin. A role for H2A.Z
                 in capping, however, has not been reported in any organism.
                 Here, I uncover such a role for Drosophila H2A.Z. Loss of
                 H2A.Z, through mutations in either its gene or the domino gene
                 for the Swr1 chromatin-remodeling protein, suppressed the
                 fusion of telomeres that lacked the protection of checkpoint
                 proteins: ATM, ATR, and the Mre11-Rad50-NBS complex. Loss of
                 H2A.Z partially restores the loading of the HOAP capping
                 protein, possibly accounting for the partial restoration in
                 capping. I propose that, in the absence of H2A.Z,
                 checkpoint-defective telomeres adopt alternative structures,
                 which are permissive for the loading of the capping machinery

                 of the cell, while the host responds with various defense
                 systems, including the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated/ATM-Rad3
                 related (ATM/ATR)-mediated DNA damage response pathways. Here
                 we show that upon viral infection, ATR directly activates the
                 p53 isoform Deltap53, leading to upregulation of the Cdk
                 inhibitor p21 and downregulation of cyclin A-Cdk2/1 (AK)
                 activity, which force the host to stay in the replicative S
                 phase. Moreover, downregulation of AK activity is a
                 prerequisite for the generation of hypophosphorylated,
                 origin-competent DNA polymerase alpha-primase (hypo-Polalpha),
                 which is, unlike AK-phosphorylated Polalpha (P-Polalpha),
                 recruited by SV40 large T antigen (T-Ag) to initiate viral DNA
                 replication. Prevention of the downregulation of AK activity
                 by inactivation of ATR-Deltap53-p21 signaling significantly
                 reduced the T-Ag-interacting hypo-Polalpha population and,
                 accordingly, SV40 replication efficiency. Moreover, the
                 ATR-Deltap53 pathway facilitates the proteasomal degradation
                 of the 180-kDa catalytic subunit of the non-T-Ag-interacting
                 P-Polalpha, giving rise to T-Ag-interacting hypo-Polalpha.
                 Thus, the purpose of activating the ATR-Deltap53-p21-mediated
                 intra-S checkpoint is to maintain the host in S phase, an
                 optimal environment for SV40 replication, and to modulate the

                 telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM-related protein (ATR)]
                 are essential in this checkpoint response, but in mammal cells
                 an ATR/ATM-independent checkpoint response to DNA synthesis
                 inhibition exists. Using HeLa cells, which have a
                 caffeine-insensitive checkpoint response, we have analyzed
                 here which molecules known to be involved in the DNA
                 replication checkpoint participate in the caffeine-insensitive
                 response. When DNA synthesis was inhibited in the presence of
                 UCN01 or after knocking down Chk1 expression [Chk1 small
                 interfering RNA (siRNA)], HeLa cells entered into aberrant
                 mitosis. Consequently, Chk1 is essential for both the
                 ATR/ATM-dependent and ATR/ATM-independent checkpoint response
                 in HeLa cells. Neither wortmannin, Ly294002, nor SB202190
                 abrogated the caffeine-insensitive checkpoint response,
                 indicating that DNA-PK and p38 alpha,beta are not involved in
                 the ATR/ATM-independent Chk1 activation upon DNA synthesis
                 inhibition. Using siRNA to knock down Rad17 and claspin, two
                 molecules involved in sensing stalled replication forks, we
                 also showed that claspin but not Rad17 is essential for the
                 ATR/ATM-independent checkpoint response. Inhibition of DNA
                 synthesis in HeLa cells led to a decrease in cyclin B1 protein
                 accumulation that was abrogated when UCN01 was added or when
                 claspin was knocked down. We conclude that upon DNA synthesis
                 inhibition, Chk1 can be activated in a claspin-dependent
                 manner independently of ATR and ATM, leading to cyclin B1

                 with gene expression, chromatin structure, and genome
                 evolution. Recent advances in genome-scale mapping of
                 replication kinetics have allowed these correlations to be
                 explored in many species, cell types, and growth conditions,
                 and these large data sets have allowed quantitative and
                 computational analyses. One striking new correlation to emerge
                 from these analyses is between replication timing and the
                 three-dimensional structure of chromosomes. This correlation,
                 which is significantly stronger than with any single histone
                 modification or chromosome-binding protein, suggests that
                 replication timing is controlled at the level of chromosomal
                 domains. This conclusion dove tails with parallel work on the
                 heterogeneity of origin firing and the competition between
                 origins for limiting activators to suggest a model in which
                 the stochastic probability of individual origin firing is
                 modulated by chromosomal domain structure to produce patterns
                 of replication. Whether these patterns have inherent
                 biological functions or simply reflect higher-order genome

                 However, the molecular details about the correlation between

                 unclear. To investigate the connections between DNA
                 replication and DNA damage checkpoint, a DNA-damage reagent,
                 tripchlorolide, was applied to CHO (Chinese ovary hamster)
                 cells at early- or middle-stages of the S phase. The
                 early-S-phase treatment with TC significantly delayed the
                 progression of the S phase and caused the phosphorylation of
                 the Chk1 checkpoint protein, whereas the middle-S-phase
                 treatment only slightly slowed down the progression of the S

                 transfection using electroporation. The transient
                 extrachromosomal replication, stable maintenance, and late
                 amplification of the viral genome could be studied for high-
                 and low-risk mucosal and cutaneous papillomaviruses. Recent
                 findings indicate that the cellular DNA damage response (DDR)
                 is activated during the HPV life cycle and that the viral
                 replication protein E1 might play a role in this process. We
                 used a U2OS cell-based system to study E1-dependent DDR
                 activation and the involvement of these pathways in viral
                 transient replication. We demonstrated that the E1 protein
                 could cause double-strand DNA breaks in the host genome by
                 directly interacting with DNA. This activity leads to the
                 induction of an ATM-dependent signaling cascade and cell cycle

                 by replication proteins E1 and E2. The ATR pathway in viral
                 replication centers is likely activated through DNA
                 replication stress and might play an important role in

                 of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in macaque monkeys by
                 mapping their receptive fields in space and time. The mapping
                 was performed by reverse correlation of a spike train of a
                 neuron with pseudorandom, binary level stimuli (m-sequence
                 grids). Black and white m-sequence grids were used to map the
                 receptive field for luminance. The locations of receptive
                 field center and surround were determined from this luminance
                 map. To map the contribution of each cone class to the
                 receptive field, we designed red-green or blue-yellow
                 m-sequence grids to isolate the influence of that cone (long,
                 middle, or short wavelength-sensitive: L, M, or S).
                 Magnocellular neurons generally received synergistic input
                 from L and M cones in both the center and the surround. A
                 minority had cone-antagonistic (M-L) input to the surround.
                 Red-green opponent parvocellular neurons received opponent
                 cone input (L+M- or M+L-) that overlapped in space, as sampled
                 by our stimulus grid, but that had somewhat different extents.
                 For example, an L+ center parvocellular neuron would be L+/M-
                 in both center and surround, but the L+ signal would be
                 stronger in the center and the M- signal stronger in the
                 surround. Accordingly, the luminance receptive field would be
                 spatially antagonistic: on-center/off-surround. The space-time
                 maps also characterized LGN dynamics. For example,
                 magnocellular responses were transient, red-green
                 parvocellular responses were more sustained, and blue-on
                 responses were the most sustained for both luminance and
                 cone-isolating stimuli. For all cell types the surround
                 response peaked 8-10 msec later than the center response.",

                 mediated through the combined effects the sumo targeted
                 E3-ubiquitin ligase RNF4 and activation of the AURKA-PLK1
                 pathway. As indicated previously, Atr-deleted cells exhibited
                 a decreased ability to restart DNA replication following fork
                 stalling in comparison with control cells. However,
                 suppression of RNF4, AURKA, or PLK1 returned the reinitiation
                 of replication in Atr-deleted cells to near wild-type levels.
                 In RNF4-depleted cells, this rescue directly correlated with
                 the persistence of sumoylation of chromatin-bound factors.
                 Notably, RNF4 repression substantially suppressed the
                 accumulation of DSBs in ATR-deficient cells, and this decrease
                 in breaks was enhanced by concomitant inhibition of PLK1. DSBs
                 resulting from ATR inhibition were also observed to be
                 dependent on the endonuclease scaffold protein SLX4,
                 suggesting that RNF4 and PLK1 either help activate the SLX4
                 complex or make DNA replication fork structures accessible for
                 subsequent SLX4-dependent cleavage. Thus, replication fork
                 collapse following ATR inhibition is a multistep process that

  abstract    = "Eukaryotic chromosomes replicate in a temporal order known as
                 the replication-timing program. In mammals, replication timing
                 is cell-type-specific with at least half the genome switching
                 replication timing during development, primarily in units of
                 400-800 kilobases ('replication domains'), whose positions are
                 preserved in different cell types, conserved between species,
                 and appear to confine long-range effects of chromosome
                 rearrangements. Early and late replication correlate,
                 respectively, with open and closed three-dimensional chromatin
                 compartments identified by high-resolution chromosome
                 conformation capture (Hi-C), and, to a lesser extent, late
                 replication correlates with lamina-associated domains (LADs).
                 Recent Hi-C mapping has unveiled substructure within chromatin
                 compartments called topologically associating domains (TADs)
                 that are largely conserved in their positions between cell
                 types and are similar in size to replication domains. However,
                 TADs can be further sub-stratified into smaller domains,
                 challenging the significance of structures at any particular
                 scale. Moreover, attempts to reconcile TADs and LADs to
                 replication-timing data have not revealed a common, underlying
                 domain structure. Here we localize boundaries of replication
                 domains to the early-replicating border of replication-timing
                 transitions and map their positions in 18 human and 13 mouse
                 cell types. We demonstrate that, collectively, replication
                 domain boundaries share a near one-to-one correlation with TAD
                 boundaries, whereas within a cell type, adjacent TADs that
                 replicate at similar times obscure replication domain
                 boundaries, largely accounting for the previously reported
                 lack of alignment. Moreover, cell-type-specific replication
                 timing of TADs partitions the genome into two large-scale
                 sub-nuclear compartments revealing that replication-timing
                 transitions are indistinguishable from late-replicating
                 regions in chromatin composition and lamina association and
                 accounting for the reduced correlation of replication timing
                 to LADs and heterochromatin. Our results reconcile
                 cell-type-specific sub-nuclear compartmentalization and
                 replication timing with developmentally stable structural
                 domains and offer a unified model for large-scale chromosome

                 53BP1 to double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, it is not clear
                 how 53BP1 is specifically targeted to the sites of DNA damage,
                 as the overall level of H4K20me2 does not seem to increase
                 following DNA damage. It has been proposed that DNA breaks may
                 cause exposure of methylated H4K20 previously buried within
                 the chromosome; however, experimental evidence for such a
                 model is lacking. Here we found that H4K20 methylation
                 actually increases locally upon the induction of DSBs and that
                 methylation of H4K20 at DSBs is mediated by the histone
                 methyltransferase MMSET (also known as NSD2 or WHSC1) in

                 methylation at DSBs and the subsequent accumulation of 53BP1.
                 Furthermore, we found that the recruitment of MMSET to DSBs
                 requires the gammaH2AX-MDC1 pathway; specifically, the
                 interaction between the MDC1 BRCT domain and phosphorylated
                 Ser 102 of MMSET. Thus, we propose that a pathway involving
                 gammaH2AX-MDC1-MMSET regulates the induction of H4K20
                 methylation on histones around DSBs, which, in turn,
                 facilitates 53BP1 recruitment.",

                 fragile sites. However, the molecular basis for this
                 instability is unknown. Here, we show that even under normal
                 growth conditions, replication fork progression along the
                 fragile site, FRA16C, is slow and forks frequently stall at
                 AT-rich sequences, leading to activation of additional origins
                 to enable replication completion. Under mild replication
                 stress, the frequency of stalling at AT-rich sequences is
                 further increased. Strikingly, unlike in the entire genome, in
                 the FRA16C region additional origins are not activated,
                 suggesting that all potential origins are already activated
                 under normal conditions. Thus, the basis for FRA16C fragility
                 is replication fork stalling at AT-rich sequences and
                 inability to activate additional origins under replication
                 stress. Our results provide a mechanism explaining the

                 kinase required for survival after DNA damage. A critical role
                 for ATR has been hypothesized to be the regulation of p53 and
                 other cell cycle checkpoints. ATR has been shown to
                 phosphorylate p53 at Ser(15), and this damage-induced
                 phosphorylation is diminished by expression of a catalytically
                 inactive (ATR-kd) mutant. p53 function could not be examined
                 directly in prior studies of ATR, however, because p53 was
                 mutant or because cells expressed the SV40 large T antigen
                 that blocks p53 function. To test the interactions of ATR and
                 p53 directly we generated human U2OS cell lines inducible for
                 either wild-type or kinase-dead ATR that also have an intact
                 p53 pathway. Indeed, ATR-kd expression sensitized these cells
                 to DNA damage and caused a transient decrease in
                 damage-induced serine 15 phosphorylation of p53. However, we
                 found that the effects of ATR-kd expression do not result in
                 blocking the response of p53 to DNA damage. Specifically,
                 prior ATR-kd expression had no effect on DNA damage-induced
                 p53 protein up-regulation, p53-DNA binding, p21 mRNA
                 up-regulation, or G(1) arrest. Instead of promoting survival
                 via p53 regulation, we found that ATR protects cells by
                 delaying the generation of mitotic phosphoproteins and
                 inhibiting premature chromatin condensation after DNA damage
                 or hydroxyurea. Although p53 inhibition (by E6 or MDM2
                 expression) had little effect on premature chromatin
                 condensation, when combined with ATR-kd expression there was a
                 marked loss of the replication checkpoint. We conclude that
                 ATR and p53 can function independently but that loss of both

                 origins. Although ORC is conserved from yeast to humans, the
                 DNA sequence elements that specify ORC binding are not. In
                 particular, metazoan ORC shows no obvious DNA sequence
                 specificity, whereas yeast ORC binds to a specific DNA

                 on the role of the conserved N-terminal bromo-adjacent
                 homology domain of yeast Orc1 (Orc1BAH). Recent studies

                 relevant to DNA replication in vivo. This replication role was
                 separable from the Orc1BAH domain's previously defined role in
                 transcriptional silencing. Genome-wide analyses of ORC binding
                 in ORC1 and orc1bahDelta cells revealed that the Orc1BAH
                 domain contributed to ORC's association with most yeast
                 origins, including a class of origins highly dependent on the
                 Orc1BAH domain for ORC association (orc1bahDelta-sensitive

                 were associated with a distinct local nucleosome structure.

                 processes is well established, defining the specific
                 contribution of individual histone residues remains a
                 challenge because many histone-modifying enzymes have
                 nonhistone targets. This challenge is exacerbated by the

                 autoradiographically. Thirty-eight mdx mice aged 23 d were
                 injected with tritiated thymidine to label myoblasts
                 replicating early in the dystrophic process. At intervals from
                 8 h to 30 d after injection the tibialis anterior muscles were
                 removed, processed for autoradiography and analysed for
                 labelled central myonuclei (derived from the progeny of
                 myoblasts which had been labelled at 23 d). At 8 h after
                 injection there were no labelled central myonuclei, showing
                 that the labelled myoblasts had not fused within this time. At
                 1 d, 2 \% of central myonuclei were labelled, at 2 d, up to
                 32\% were labelled, at 3 d approximately 60\% were labelled,
                 and at 4 d the labelling peaked at 74\%. In the 27 mice
                 sampled from 5-30 d after injection, the levels of central
                 myonuclear labelling varied enormously: from 1-63\%. However,
                 there was a consistent decrease in the numbers of labelled
                 central myonuclei with time. This may have been due to
                 dilution of the relative numbers of labelled myonuclei due to
                 other, nonlabelled, myoblasts replicating after the
                 availability of tritiated thymidine, and fusing. It was also
                 possible that labelled myofibres underwent subsequent necrosis
                 and were eliminated from the muscle. The proposal that a
                 regenerated myofibre can undergo a subsequent cycle of

                 necrotic myofibres with labelled and unlabelled central

                 (Plk2/Snk) is a direct target for transcriptional regulation
                 by p53 and that silencing Plk2 sensitizes cancer cells to
                 Taxol-induced apoptosis. Our goals have been to better
                 understand why Plk2 is regulated by p53 and how Plk2 signals
                 protection from cell death through checkpoint activation. We
                 found that following knock-down of Plk2 in wild-type p53
                 expressing H460 human non-small cell lung cancer cells there
                 was a significant increase in cell death observed in
                 aphidicolin-treated cells and a further increase after release
                 from aphidicolin-block. The highest levels of cell death were
                 observed when Plk2-deficient cells were released from both
                 aphidicolin and etoposide treatment. These results suggested
                 that a defective S-phase checkpoint may contribute to enhanced
                 sensitivity of Plk2-deficient cells to replication stress.
                 Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed higher levels of
                 Serine 139 H2AX phosphorylation in Plk2-deficient as compared
                 to control cells before and after aphidicolin treatment
                 indicating that there is more DNA damage when Plk2 is
                 depleted. We also observed higher levels of Chk1 protein in
                 Plk2-deficient cells that were associated with reduced levels
                 of Serine 317-phosphorylated Chk1. In aphidicolin-treated
                 cells, there were lower levels of Serine 317-phosphorylated
                 Chk1 when Plk2 was knocked-down. Plk2 was demonstrated to
                 interact with Chk2, Chk1, Serine 317-phosphorylated Chk1 and
                 p53. Thus, increased cell death observed after aphidicolin
                 treatment and release in Plk2-deficient cells may result from
                 both higher levels of replication stress-induced DNA damage

                 ATR activators RPA, 9-1-1, and Rad17 to chromatin.
                 Surprisingly, ATR activation was accompanied by only a slight
                 increase in single-stranded DNA, and the ATR targets RPA2 and
                 Chk1, a cell cycle checkpoint kinase, were not phosphorylated.
                 However, ATR activation resulted in phosphorylation of the
                 replicative helicase subunit MCM2, an ATR effector. Polyamide
                 treatment also induced accumulation of monoubiquitinated
                 FANCD2, which is recruited to stalled replication forks and
                 interacts transiently with phospho-MCM2. This suggests that
                 polyamides induce replication stress that ATR can counteract
                 independently of Chk1 and that the FA/BRCA pathway may also be
                 involved in the response to polyamides. In biochemical assays,
                 polyamides inhibit DNA helicases, providing a plausible
                 mechanism for S-phase inhibition.",

                 but the mechanism underlying this observation is unknown.
                 Specifically, although the ataxia-telangiectasia-rad3 related
                 (ATR) kinase has been shown to be activated in hypoxic cells,
                 several studies have not been able to document down-stream
                 consequences of ATR activation in these cells. By clearly
                 defining the DNA replication initiation checkpoint in hypoxic
                 cells, we now demonstrate that ATR is responsible for
                 activating this checkpoint. We show that the hypoxic
                 activation of ATR leads to the phosphorylation-dependent
                 degradation of the cdc25a phosphatase. Downregulation of
                 cdc25a protein by ATR in hypoxic cells decreases CDK2
                 phosphorylation and activity, which results in the degradation
                 of cdc6 by APC/C(Cdh1). These events do not occur in hypoxic
                 cells when ATR is depleted, and the initiation of DNA
                 replication is maintained. We therefore present a novel
                 mechanism of cdc6 regulation in which ATR can have a central
                 role in inhibiting the initiation of DNA replication by the
                 regulation of cdc6 by APC/C(Cdh1). This model provides insight

                 is essential to chromosomal stability. Replication origins in
                 early frog embryos are located at apparently random sequences,
                 are spaced at close ( approximately 10-kb) intervals, and are
                 activated in clusters that fire at different times throughout
                 a very brief S phase. Using molecular combing of DNA from
                 sperm nuclei replicating in Xenopus egg extracts, we show that
                 the temporal order of origin firing can be modulated by the
                 nucleocytoplasmic ratio and the checkpoint-abrogating agent
                 caffeine in the absence of external challenge. Increasing the
                 concentration of nuclei in the extract increases S phase
                 length. Contrary to a previous interpretation, this does not
                 result from a change in local origin spacing but from a
                 spreading of the time over which distinct origin clusters fire
                 and from a decrease in replication fork velocity. Caffeine
                 addition or ATR inhibition with a specific neutralizing
                 antibody increases origin firing early in S phase, suggesting
                 that a checkpoint controls the time of origin firing during
                 unperturbed S phase. Furthermore, fork progression is impaired
                 when excess forks are assembled after caffeine treatment. We
                 also show that caffeine allows more early origin firing with
                 low levels of aphidicolin treatment but not higher levels. We

                 genome-wide distribution of ORC in Drosophila and found that
                 ORC localizes to specific chromosomal locations in the absence
                 of any discernible simple motif. Although no clear sequence

                 complex sequence features that define ORC binding sites are

                 feature that is deterministic for ORC binding. ORC-associated
                 sequences are enriched for the histone variant, H3.3, often at
                 transcription start sites, and depleted for bulk nucleosomes.
                 The density of ORC binding along the chromosome is reflected
                 in the time at which a sequence replicates, with early
                 replicating sequences having a high density of ORC binding.
                 Finally, we found a high concordance between sites of ORC
                 binding and cohesin loading, suggesting that, in addition to

                 transiently at three prominent replication fork pausing sites
                 (RFPs) located in or immediately adjacent to nucleosome-free
                 regions of the 5' NTS. Pausing at these sites is dramatically
                 diminished during replication in Escherichia coli, suggesting
                 that chromatin organization or Tetrahymena-specific proteins
                 may be required. A conserved tripartite sequence was
                 identified at each pausing site. Mutations in type I elements
                 diminish pausing at proximal RFPs. Hence, type I elements,
                 previously shown to control replication initiation, also
                 regulate elongation of existing replication forks. Studies
                 with rDNA transformants revealed a strong directional bias for
                 fork pausing. Strong pausing only occurred in forks moving
                 toward the rRNA-coding region. We propose that fork pausing in
                 the 5' NTS evolved to synchronize replication and
                 transcription of the downstream rRNA genes.",

                 remain poorly understood. To gain insights into these
                 mechanisms, we developed a systematic approach using a
                 Drosophila high-resolution genomic microarray to determine
                 replication timing, identify replication origins, and map
                 protein-binding sites along a chromosome arm. We identify a
                 defined temporal pattern of replication that correlates with
                 the density of active transcription. These data indicate that
                 the influence of transcription status on replication timing is
                 exerted over large domains (>100 kb) rather than at the level
                 of individual genes. We identify 62 early activating
                 replication origins across the chromosome by mapping sites of
                 nucleotide incorporation during hydroxyurea arrest. Using
                 genome-wide location analysis, we demonstrate that the origin
                 recognition complex (ORC) is localized to specific chromosomal
                 sites, many of which coincide with early activating origins.
                 The molecular attributes of ORC-binding sites include
                 increased AT-content and association with a subset of RNA Pol
                 II-binding sites. Based on these findings, we suggest that the
                 distribution of transcription along the chromosome acts

                 sufficient dynamics to allow access to specific sequences and
                 features such as genes and regulatory elements. This is
                 achieved via the dynamic nucleoprotein organization of
                 eukaryotic DNA into chromatin. The basic unit of chromatin,
                 the nucleosome, comprises a core particle with 147 bp of DNA
                 wrapped 1.7 times around an octamer of histones. The
                 nucleosome is a highly versatile and modular structure, both
                 in its composition, with the existence of various histone
                 variants, and through the addition of a series of
                 posttranslational modifications on the histones. This

                 genes involved in the Mendelian disorder long QT syndrome

                 identify candidate genes that were subsequently confirmed in

                 throughout S-phase according to a precise timing programme.
                 When replication fork progression is inhibited, an
                 intra-S-phase checkpoint is activated that blocks further
                 origin firing and stabilizes existing replication forks to
                 prevent them undergoing irreversible collapse. We show that
                 chromatin incubated in Xenopus egg extracts displays a
                 replication-timing programme in which firing of new
                 replication origins during S phase depends on the continued
                 activity of S-phase-inducing cyclin-dependent kinases. We also
                 show that low concentrations of the DNA-polymerase inhibitor
                 aphidicolin, which only slightly slows replication-fork
                 progression, strongly suppress further initiation events. This
                 intra-S-phase checkpoint can be overcome by caffeine, an
                 inhibitor of the ATM/ATR checkpoint kinases, or by
                 neutralizing antibodies to ATR. However, depletion or
                 inhibition of Chk1 did not abolish the checkpoint. We could
                 detect no significant effect on fork stability when this
                 intra-S-phase checkpoint was inhibited. Interestingly,
                 although caffeine could prevent the checkpoint from being
                 activated, it could not rescue replication if added after the
                 timing programme would normally have been executed. This
                 suggests that special mechanisms might be necessary to reverse
                 the effects of the intra-S-phase checkpoint once it has acted

                 the establishment of broad domains (>100 kb) that replicate

                 inheritance; however, the molecular mechanisms that define and
                 establish these domains are poorly understood. The modENCODE
                 Project provided an opportunity to investigate the chromatin
                 features that define the Drosophila replication timing program
                 in multiple cell lines. The majority of early and late
                 replicating domains in the Drosophila genome were static
                 across all cell lines; however, a small subset of domains was
                 dynamic and exhibited differences in replication timing
                 between the cell lines. Both origin selection and activation
                 contribute to defining the DNA replication program. Our
                 results suggest that static early and late replicating domains
                 were defined at the level of origin selection (ORC binding)
                 and likely mediated by chromatin accessibility. In contrast,
                 dynamic domains exhibited low ORC densities in both cell
                 types, suggesting that origin activation and not origin
                 selection governs the plasticity of the DNA replication
                 program. Finally, we show that the male-specific early
                 replication of the X chromosome is dependent on the dosage
                 compensation complex (DCC), suggesting that the transcription
                 and replication programs respond to the same chromatin cues.
                 Specifically, MOF-mediated hyperacetylation of H4K16 on the X
                 chromosome promotes both the up-regulation of male-specific

                 Project provided an opportunity to investigate the chromatin
                 features that define the Drosophila replication timing program
                 in multiple cell lines. The majority of early and late
                 replicating domains in the Drosophila genome were static
                 across all cell lines; however, a small subset of domains was
                 dynamic and exhibited differences in replication timing
                 between the cell lines. Both origin selection and activation
                 contribute to defining the DNA replication program. Our
                 results suggest that static early and late replicating domains
                 were defined at the level of origin selection (ORC binding)
                 and likely mediated by chromatin accessibility. In contrast,
                 dynamic domains exhibited low ORC densities in both cell
                 types, suggesting that origin activation and not origin
                 selection governs the plasticity of the DNA replication
                 program. Finally, we show that the male-specific early
                 replication of the X chromosome is dependent on the dosage
                 compensation complex (DCC), suggesting that the transcription
                 and replication programs respond to the same chromatin cues.
                 Specifically, MOF-mediated hyperacetylation of H4K16 on the X
                 chromosome promotes both the up-regulation of male-specific
                 transcription and origin activation.",

                 flanking regions to cover long distances in order to complete
                 replication. We also show that origins of the flanking regions
                 fire in mid-S phase, leaving the site incompletely replicated
                 upon fork slowing. Notably, FRA3B instability is specific to
                 cells showing this particular initiation pattern. The fact
                 that both origin setting and replication timing are highly
                 plastic in mammalian cells explains the tissue specificity of
                 common fragile site instability we observed. Thus, we propose
                 that common fragile sites correspond to the latest
                 initiation-poor regions to complete replication in a given
                 cell type. For historical reasons, common fragile sites have
                 been essentially mapped in lymphocytes. Therefore, common
                 fragile site contribution to chromosomal rearrangements in
                 tumours should be reassessed after mapping fragile sites in
                 the cell type from which each tumour originates.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Structural rearrangements of the genome resulting in
              genic imbalance due to copy number change are often deleterious
              at the organismal level, but are common in immortalized cell
              lines and tumors, where they may be an advantage to cells. In
              order to explore the biological consequences of copy number
              changes in the Drosophila genome, we resequenced the genomes of
              19 tissue-culture cell lines and generated RNA-Seq profiles.
              RESULTS: Our work revealed dramatic duplications and deletions in
              all cell lines. We found three lines of evidence indicating that
              copy number changes were due to selection during tissue culture.
              First, we found that copy numbers correlated to maintain
              stoichiometric balance in protein complexes and biochemical
              pathways, consistent with the gene balance hypothesis. Second,
              while most copy number changes were cell line-specific, we
              identified some copy number changes shared by many of the
              independent cell lines. These included dramatic recurrence of
              increased copy number of the PDGF/VEGF receptor, which is also
              over-expressed in many cancer cells, and of bantam, an
              anti-apoptosis miRNA. Third, even when copy number changes seemed
              distinct between lines, there was strong evidence that they
              supported a common phenotypic outcome. For example, we found that
              proto-oncogenes were over-represented in one cell line (S2-DRSC),
              whereas tumor suppressor genes were under-represented in another
              (Kc167). CONCLUSION: Our study illustrates how genome structure
              changes may contribute to selection of cell lines in vitro. This
              has implications for other cell-level natural selection
              progressions, including tumorigenesis.",

  abstract    = "In metazoans, the 3' end of histone mRNA is not polyadenylated
                 but instead ends with a stem-loop structure that is required
                 for cell cycle-regulated expression. The sequence of the
                 stem-loop in the Drosophila melanogaster histone H2b, H3, and
                 H4 genes is identical to the consensus sequence of other
                 metazoan histone mRNAs, but the sequence of the stem-loop in
                 the D. melanogaster histone H2a and H1 genes is novel. dSLBP
                 binds to these novel stem-loop sequences as well as the
                 canonical stem-loop with similar affinity. Eggs derived from
                 females containing a viable, hypomorphic mutation in dSLBP
                 store greatly reduced amounts of all five histone mRNAs in the
                 egg, indicating that dSLBP is required in the maternal germ
                 line for production of each histone mRNA. Embryos deficient in
                 zygotic dSLBP function accumulate poly(A)(+) versions of all
                 five histone mRNAs as a result of usage of polyadenylation
                 signals located 3' of the stem-loop in each histone gene.
                 Since the 3' ends of adjacent histone genes are close
                 together, these polyadenylation signals may ensure the
                 termination of transcription in order to prevent read-through
                 into the next gene, which could possibly disrupt transcription
                 or produce antisense histone mRNA that might trigger RNA
                 interference. During early wild-type embryogenesis, ubiquitous
                 zygotic histone gene transcription is activated at the end of
                 the syncytial nuclear cycles during S phase of cycle 14,
                 silenced during the subsequent G(2) phase, and then
                 reactivated near the end of that G(2) phase in the
                 well-described mitotic domain pattern. There is little or no
                 dSLBP protein provided maternally in wild-type embryos, and
                 zygotic expression of dSLBP is immediately required to process
                 newly made histone pre-mRNA.",

                 transducing molecular events at chromatin to biological
                 outcomes. Effector proteins influence DNA-templated processes,
                 including transcription, DNA recombination and DNA repair;
                 however, no effector functions have yet been identified within
                 the mammalian machinery that regulate DNA replication. Here we
                 show that ORC1--a component of ORC (origin of replication
                 complex), which mediates pre-DNA replication
                 licensing--contains a bromo adjacent homology (BAH) domain
                 that specifically recognizes histone H4 dimethylated at lysine
                 20 (H4K20me2). Recognition of H4K20me2 is a property common to
                 BAH domains present within diverse metazoan ORC1 proteins.
                 Structural studies reveal that the specificity of the BAH
                 domain for H4K20me2 is mediated by a dynamic aromatic
                 dimethyl-lysine-binding cage and multiple intermolecular
                 contacts involving the bound peptide. H4K20me2 is enriched at
                 replication origins, and abrogating ORC1 recognition of
                 H4K20me2 in cells impairs ORC1 occupancy at replication
                 origins, ORC chromatin loading and cell-cycle progression.
                 Mutation of the ORC1 BAH domain has been implicated in the
                 aetiology of Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS), a form of primordial
                 dwarfism, and ORC1 depletion in zebrafish results in an
                 MGS-like phenotype. We find that wild-type human ORC1, but not
                 ORC1-H4K20me2-binding mutants, rescues the growth retardation
                 of orc1 morphants. Moreover, zebrafish depleted of H4K20me2
                 have diminished body size, mirroring the phenotype of orc1
                 morphants. Together, our results identify the BAH domain as a

                 monomethylates the histone 4 lysine 20 residue plays important

                 employing peptide arrays we have shown that it has a long

                 viz. R(17)-H(18)-(R(19)KY)-K(20)-(V(21)ILFY)-(L(22)FY)-R(23).
                 Celluspots peptide array methylation studies confirmed
                 specific monomethylation of H4K20 and revealed that the
                 symmetric and asymmetric methylation on R(17) of the H4 tail
                 inhibits methylation on H4K20. Similarly, dimethylation of the
                 R located at the -3 position also reduced methylation of p53
                 K382 which had been shown previously to be methylated by SET8.
                 Based on the derived specificity profile, we identified 4
                 potential non-histone substrate proteins. After relaxing the
                 specificity profile, we identified several more candidate
                 substrates and showed efficient methylation of 20 novel
                 non-histone peptides by SET8. However, apart from H4 and p53
                 none of the identified novel peptide targets was methylated at
                 the protein level. Since H4 and p53 both contain the target
                 lysine in an unstructured part of the protein, we conclude
                 that the long recognition sequence of SET8 makes it difficult
                 to methylate a lysine in a folded region of a protein, because

                 critical role in postinitiation transcriptional regulation at
                 many metazoan genes. We showed recently that histone H4 lysine
                 16 acetylation (H4K16Ac), mediated by the MSL complex,
                 facilitates the release of paused Pol II. In contrast, H4
                 lysine 20 trimethylation (H4K20me3), mediated by SUV420H2,
                 enforces Pol II pausing by inhibiting MSL recruitment.
                 However, how the balance between H4K16Ac and H4K20me3 is
                 locally regulated remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that
                 PR-SET7/SETD8, which monomethylates histone H4 lysine 20
                 (H4K20me1), controls both H4K16Ac and H4K20me3 and in doing
                 so, regulates Pol II pausing dynamics. We find that
                 PR-SET7-mediated H4K20me1 is necessary for the recruitment of
                 the MSL complex, subsequent H4K16Ac, and release of Pol II
                 into active elongation. Although dispensable for SUV420H2
                 recruitment, PR-SET7-mediated H4K20me1 is required for
                 H4K20me3. Although depletion of SUV420H2 is sufficient to
                 deplete H4K20me3 and relieve an H4K20me3-induced pause,
                 pausing is maintained in the absence of PR-SET7 despite
                 H4K20me3 depletion because of an inability to recruit the MSL
                 complex in the absence of H4K20me1. These findings highlight
                 the requirement for PR-SET7 and H4K20me1 in establishing both
                 the H4K16Ac and H4K20me3 marks and point to a dual role in the

  abstract    = "RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter-proximal pausing plays a
                 critical role in postinitiation transcriptional regulation at
                 many metazoan genes. We showed recently that histone H4 lysine
                 16 acetylation (H4K16Ac), mediated by the MSL complex,
                 facilitates the release of paused Pol II. In contrast, H4
                 lysine 20 trimethylation (H4K20me3), mediated by SUV420H2,
                 enforces Pol II pausing by inhibiting MSL recruitment.
                 However, how the balance between H4K16Ac and H4K20me3 is
                 locally regulated remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that
                 PR-SET7/SETD8, which monomethylates histone H4 lysine 20
                 (H4K20me1), controls both H4K16Ac and H4K20me3 and in doing
                 so, regulates Pol II pausing dynamics. We find that
                 PR-SET7-mediated H4K20me1 is necessary for the recruitment of
                 the MSL complex, subsequent H4K16Ac, and release of Pol II
                 into active elongation. Although dispensable for SUV420H2
                 recruitment, PR-SET7-mediated H4K20me1 is required for
                 H4K20me3. Although depletion of SUV420H2 is sufficient to
                 deplete H4K20me3 and relieve an H4K20me3-induced pause,
                 pausing is maintained in the absence of PR-SET7 despite
                 H4K20me3 depletion because of an inability to recruit the MSL
                 complex in the absence of H4K20me1. These findings highlight
                 the requirement for PR-SET7 and H4K20me1 in establishing both
                 the H4K16Ac and H4K20me3 marks and point to a dual role in the

                 II (Pol II) at their promoters, despite a lack of significant
                 full-length transcript. Such genes exhibit promoter-proximal
                 ``pausing,'' wherein initiated Pol II accumulates just
                 downstream of the transcription start site due to a
                 rate-limiting step mediating the transition to elongation. The
                 mechanisms that regulate the escape of Pol II from pausing and
                 the relationship to chromatin structure remain incompletely
                 understood. Recently, we showed that CpG island
                 hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing of TMS1/ASC in human
                 breast cancers are accompanied by a local shift from histone
                 H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16Ac) to H4 lysine 20
                 trimethylation (H4K20me3). Here, we show that hMOF-mediated
                 H4K16Ac and SUV420H2-mediated H4K20me3 play opposing roles in
                 the regulation of Pol II pausing. We found that H4K16Ac
                 promoted the release of Pol II from pausing through the
                 recruitment of BRD4 and pTEFb. Aberrant methylation of CpG
                 island DNA blocked Pol II recruitment to gene promoters.
                 Whereas the inhibition of DNA methylation allowed for the
                 reassociation and initiation of Pol II at the TMS1 promoter,
                 Pol II remained paused in the presence of H4K20me3. Combined
                 inhibition of H4K20me3 and DNA methylation resulted in the
                 rerecruitment of hMOF and subsequent H4K16Ac, release of Pol
                 II into active elongation, and synergistic reactivation of
                 TMS1 expression. Marking by H4K20me3 was not restricted to
                 TMS1 but also occurred at other genes independently of DNA
                 methylation, where it similarly imposed a block to Pol II
                 promoter escape through a mechanism that involved the local
                 inhibition of H4K16Ac. These data indicate that H4K20me3
                 invokes gene repression by antagonizing hMOF-mediated H4K16Ac
                 and suggest that overcoming Pol II pausing might be a

                 loss-of-function through an integrated bioinformatics and
                 functional genomics approach. We find that bi-allelic SETD2

                 use a mutant of rpa1 gene, rfa1-t11, that has defects in
                 recruiting checkpoint sensor proteins to the site of double

                 considerable interest in vaccine research. Merozoite surface
                 protein 7 (MSP7) forms a complex with MSP1 and is encoded by a
                 member of a multigene family located on chromosome 13. The
                 family codes for MSP7 and five MSP7-related proteins (MSRPs).
                 In the present study, we have investigated the expression and
                 the effect of msrp gene deletion at the asexual blood stage.
                 In addition to msp7, msrp2, msrp3, and msrp5 are transcribed,
                 and mRNA was easily detected by hybridization analysis,
                 whereas mRNA for msrp1 and msrp4 could be detected only by
                 reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Notwithstanding evidence of
                 transcription, antibodies to recombinant MSRPs failed to
                 detect specific proteins, except for antibodies to MSRP2.
                 Sequential proteolytic cleavages of MSRP2 resulted in 28- and
                 25-kDa forms. However, MSRP2 was absent from merozoites; the
                 25-kDa MSRP2 protein (MSRP2(25)) was soluble and secreted upon
                 merozoite egress. The msrp genes were deleted by targeted
                 disruption in the 3D7 line, leading to ablation of full-length
                 transcripts. MSRP deletion mutants had no detectable
                 phenotype, with growth and invasion characteristics comparable
                 to those of the parental parasite; only the deletion of MSP7
                 led to a detectable growth phenotype. Thus, within this family
                 some of the genes are transcribed at a significant level in
                 asexual blood stages, but the corresponding proteins may or
                 may not be detectable. Interactions of the expressed proteins
                 with the merozoite also differ. These results highlight the

                 combinations, we conducted a synthetic lethal siRNA screen
                 using a library that targets nearly 7,000 human genes.
                 Depletion of ATR, the main transducer of replication stress,

                 inhibitor VE-821 confirmed marked antiproliferative synergy

                 VE-821 abrogates the S-phase replication elongation checkpoint

                 camptothecin and LMP-400. As expected, the combination of Top1
                 inhibitors with VE-821 inhibited the phosphorylation of ATR

                 organismal development and to prevent diseases such as cancer.
                 Nuclear DNA is packaged into chromatin, and thus genome
                 maintenance can be influenced by distinct chromatin
                 environments. In particular, post-translational modifications
                 of histones have emerged as key regulators of genomic
                 integrity. Intense research during the past few years has
                 revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as
                 critically important for the biological processes that ensure
                 genome integrity, such as DNA damage repair, DNA replication
                 and chromatin compaction. The distinct H4K20 methylation
                 states are mediated by SET8/PR-Set7 that catalyses
                 monomethylation of H4K20, whereas SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2

                 In this study, we show that SET8 is targeted for degradation

                 proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-dependent manner.
                 SET8 degradation requires a conserved degron responsible for

                 ubiquitylation occurs. Efficient degradation of SET8 at the

                 histonfe H4-K20. However, a function for SET8 in mammalian
                 cell proliferation has not been determined. We show that small

                 SET8 depletion causes DNA damage specifically during

                 mechanisms of suppression by CD8+ T cells in ACAID remain only
                 poorly understood. TGF-beta1 is considered as an inhibitory
                 cytokine for immunosuppression in some models. The production
                 of TGF-beta1 by CD8+ T cells in ACAID, and whether CD8+ T
                 cells exert suppression through TGF-beta1, is unknown. Methods
                 The suppressive effect of CD8+ T cells in ACAID mice was
                 determined by a local adoptive transfer (LAT) assay. The
                 production of TGF-beta1 by CD8+ T cells was measured by
                 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-TGF-beta1
                 antibodies were used in the LAT assay to test if they could

                 interfere with DNA replication, but the effect of this
                 interference on transcription is largely unknown. Here we show
                 that doxorubicin induces the firing of dense clusters of
                 neoreplication origins that lead to clusters of stalled
                 replication forks in gene-rich parts of the genome,
                 particularly on expressed genes. Genes that overlap with these
                 clusters of stalled forks are actively dechromatinized,
                 unwound, and repressed by an ATR-dependent checkpoint pathway.
                 The ATR checkpoint pathway causes a histone chaperone normally
                 associated with the replication fork, ASF1a, to degrade
                 through a CRL1(betaTRCP)-dependent ubiquitination/proteasome
                 pathway, leading to the localized dechromatinization and gene
                 repression. Therefore, a globally active checkpoint pathway
                 interacts with local clusters of stalled forks to specifically
                 repress genes in the vicinity of the stalled forks, providing
                 a new mechanism of action of chemotherapy drugs like
                 doxorubicin. Finally, ASF1a-depleted cancer cells are more

                 of enzymes that catalyze specific histone modifications for
                 epigenetic maintenance, and dysregulation of which contributes
                 to tumorigenesis and developmental defects. The histone

                 Here, we provide evidence to support that SET8 monomethylates

                 Seventeen patients (32.7\%) developed grade 2-3 skin rashes
                 within 4 weeks of treatment (early G2/3 rash). In the

                 genotype was correlated with early G2/3 rash; and this

                 a literature review of neonatal listeriosis as reported in

                 less than 3 days in all cases. L. monocytogenes was identified

                 chromatin dynamics. In this report we demonstrate that one of
                 these enzymes, PR-Set7, and its corresponding histone
                 modification, the monomethylation of histone H4 lysine 20
                 (H4K20), display a distinct cell cycle profile in mammalian
                 cells: low at G1, increased during late S phase and G2, and
                 maximal from prometaphase to anaphase. The lack of PR-Set7 and
                 monomethylated H4K20 resulted in a number of aberrant
                 phenotypes in several different mammalian cell types. These
                 include the inability of cells to progress past G2, global
                 chromosome condensation failure, aberrant centrosome
                 amplification, and substantial DNA damage. By employing a
                 catalytically dead dominant negative PR-Set7 mutant, we
                 discovered that its mono-methyltransferase activity was
                 required to prevent these phenotypes. Importantly, we
                 demonstrate that all of the aberrant phenotypes associated
                 with the loss of PR-Set7 enzymatic function occur
                 independently of p53. Collectively, our findings demonstrate
                 that PR-Set7 enzymatic activity is essential for mammalian
                 cell cycle progression and for the maintenance of genomic
                 stability, most likely by monomethylating histone H4K20. Our
                 results predict that alterations of this pathway could result

                 through the deposition of the centromere-specific histone
                 CENP-A. Following CENP-A deposition, additional proteins are
                 assembled on centromeric chromatin. However, it remains
                 unknown whether additional epigenetic features of centromeric
                 chromatin are required for kinetochore assembly. Here, we used
                 ChIP-seq analysis to examine centromere-specific histone
                 modifications at chicken centromeres, which lack highly
                 repetitive sequences. We found that H4K20 monomethylation
                 (H4K20me1) is enriched at centromeres. Immunofluorescence and
                 biochemical analyses revealed that H4K20me1 is present at all
                 centromeres in chicken and human cells. Based on
                 immunoprecipitation data, H4K20me1 occurs primarily on the
                 histone H4 that is assembled as part of the CENP-A nucleosome
                 following deposition of CENP-A into centromeres. Targeting the
                 H4K20me1-specific demethylase PHF8 to centromeres reduces the
                 level of H4K20me1 at centromeres and results in kinetochore
                 assembly defects. We conclude that H4K20me1 modification of

                 which consists of the histones, non-histone proteins and RNA
                 molecules that package DNA. Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans
                 and Drosophila melanogaster have contributed substantially to
                 our understanding of molecular mechanisms of genome function
                 in humans, and have revealed conservation of chromatin
                 components and mechanisms. Nevertheless, the three organisms
                 have markedly different genome sizes, chromosome architecture
                 and gene organization. On human and fly chromosomes, for
                 example, pericentric heterochromatin flanks single
                 centromeres, whereas worm chromosomes have dispersed
                 heterochromatin-like regions enriched in the distal
                 chromosomal 'arms', and centromeres distributed along their
                 lengths. To systematically investigate chromatin organization
                 and associated gene regulation across species, we generated
                 and analysed a large collection of genome-wide chromatin data
                 sets from cell lines and developmental stages in worm, fly and
                 human. Here we present over 800 new data sets from our ENCODE

                 terms of its relationship to transcriptional activity via
                 chromatin structure. However, so little is known about what
                 regulates where and when replication initiates that it has
                 been impossible to identify mechanistic and causal
                 relationships. Moreover, much of our knowledge base has been
                 anecdotal, derived from analyses of a few genes in unrelated
                 cell lines. Recent studies have revisited long-standing
                 hypotheses using genome-wide approaches. In particular, the
                 foundation of this field was recently shored up with
                 incontrovertible evidence that cellular differentiation is
                 accompanied by coordinated changes in replication timing and
                 transcription. These changes accompany subnuclear
                 repositioning, and take place at the level of megabase-sized
                 domains that transcend localized changes in chromatin
                 structure or transcription. Inferring from these results, we
                 propose that there exists a key transition during the middle
                 of S-phase and that changes in replication timing traversing
                 this period are associated with subnuclear repositioning and
                 changes in the activity of certain classes of promoters.",

                 accompanied by changes in replication timing. To explore the
                 relationship between replication timing and cell fate
                 transitions, we constructed genome-wide replication-timing
                 profiles of 22 independent mouse cell lines representing 10
                 stages of early mouse development, and transcription profiles
                 for seven of these stages. Replication profiles were cell-type
                 specific, with 45\% of the genome exhibiting significant
                 changes at some point during development that were generally
                 coordinated with changes in transcription. Comparison of early
                 and late epiblast cell culture models revealed a set of
                 early-to-late replication switches completed at a stage
                 equivalent to the post-implantation epiblast, prior to germ
                 layer specification and down-regulation of key pluripotency
                 transcription factors [POU5F1 (also known as OCT4)/NANOG/SOX2]
                 and coinciding with the emergence of compact chromatin near
                 the nuclear periphery. These changes were maintained in all
                 subsequent lineages (lineage-independent) and involved a group
                 of irreversibly down-regulated genes, at least some of which
                 were repositioned closer to the nuclear periphery.
                 Importantly, many genomic regions of partially reprogrammed
                 induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs) failed to re-establish
                 ESC-specific replication-timing and transcription programs.
                 These regions were enriched for lineage-independent
                 early-to-late changes, which in female cells included the
                 inactive X chromosome. Together, these results constitute a
                 comprehensive ``fate map'' of replication-timing changes
                 during early mouse development. Moreover, they support a model
                 in which a distinct set of replication domains undergoes a
                 form of ``autosomal Lyonization'' in the epiblast that is
                 difficult to reprogram and coincides with an epigenetic

                 cellular differentiation has been difficult to substantiate.
                 Studies have largely been restricted to the comparison of a
                 few genes in established cell lines derived from different
                 tissues, and most of these genes do not change replication
                 timing. Hence, it has not been possible to predict how many or
                 what types of genes might be subject to such control. Here, we
                 have evaluated the replication timing of 54 tissue-specific
                 genes in mouse embryonic stem cells before and after
                 differentiation to neural precursors. Strikingly, genes
                 residing within isochores rich in GC and poor in long
                 interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) did not change their

                 programmed changes in replication timing that accompanied

                 evidence that differentiation-induced autosomal

                 development, provide a means to predict genes subject to such

                 concluding that there are very few changes in replication
                 timing during development. Recently, the first genome-wide
                 study of replication timing during the course of
                 differentiation revealed extensive changes that were strongly
                 associated with changes in transcriptional activity and
                 subnuclear organization. Domains of temporally coordinate

                 replication-timing effect on mutation rate, but the mechanisms
                 that regulate the increase in mutation rate as the genome is
                 replicated remain unclear. Evidence is emerging, however, that
                 DNA repair systems, in general, are less efficient in late
                 replicating heterochromatic regions compared to early
                 replicating euchromatic regions of the genome. At the same
                 time, mutation rates in both vertebrates and invertebrates
                 have been shown to vary with generation time (GT). GT is
                 correlated with genome size, which suggests a possible
                 nucleotypic effect on species-specific mutation rates. These
                 and other observations all converge on a role for DNA
                 replication checkpoints in modulating generation times and
                 mutation rates during the DNA synthetic phase (S phase) of the

  abstract    = "Although p300 and CBP lysine acetyltransferases are often
                 treated interchangeably, the inability of one enzyme to
                 compensate for the loss of the other suggests unique roles for
                 each. As these deficiencies coincide with aberrant levels of
                 histone acetylation, we hypothesized that the key difference
                 between p300 and CBP activity is differences in their
                 specificity/selectivity for lysines within the histones.
                 Utilizing a label-free, quantitative mass spectrometry based
                 technique, we determined the kinetic parameters of both CBP
                 and p300 at each lysine of H3 and H4, under conditions we
                 would expect to encounter in the cell (either limiting
                 acetyl-CoA or histone). Our results show that while p300 and
                 CBP acetylate many common residues on H3 and H4, they do in
                 fact possess very different specificities, and these
                 specificities are dependent on whether histone or acetyl-CoA
                 is limiting. Steady-state experiments with limiting H3
                 demonstrate that both CBP and p300 acetylate H3K14, H3K18,
                 H3K23, with p300 having specificities up to 10(1)(0)-fold
                 higher than CBP. Utilizing tetramer as a substrate, both
                 enzymes also acetylate H4K5, H4K8, H4K12, and H4K16. With
                 limiting tetramer, CBP displays higher specificities,
                 especially at H3K18, where CBP specificity is 10(3)(2)-fold
                 higher than p300. With limiting acetyl-CoA, p300 has the
                 highest specificity at H4K16, where specificity is
                 10(1)(8)-fold higher than CBP. This discovery of unique
                 specificity for targets of CBP- vs p300-mediated acetylation
                 of histone lysine residues presents a new model for
                 understanding their respective biological roles and possibly

                 mitosis is not initiated before DNA synthesis is completed.
                 Recent studies using Xenopus extracts have demonstrated that
                 activation of the replication checkpoint and phosphorylation
                 of the Chk1 kinase are dependent on RNA primer synthesis by
                 DNA polymerase alpha, and it has been suggested that the ATR
                 kinase-so-called because it is related to the product of the
                 gene that is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia (ATM) and to
                 Rad3 kinase-may be an upstream component of this response. It
                 has been difficult to test this hypothesis as an ATR-deficient
                 system suitable for biochemical studies has not been
                 available. RESULTS: We have cloned the Xenopus laevis homolog
                 of ATR (XATR) and studied the function of the protein in
                 Xenopus egg extracts. Using a chromatin-binding assay, we
                 found that ATR associates with chromatin after initiation of
                 replication, dissociates from chromatin upon completion of
                 replication, and accumulates in the presence of aphidicolin,
                 an inhibitor of DNA replication. Its association with
                 chromatin was inhibited by treatment with actinomycin D, an
                 inhibitor of RNA primase. There was an early rise in the
                 activity of Cdc2-cyclin B in egg extracts depleted of ATR both
                 in the presence or absence of aphidicolin. In addition, the
                 premature mitosis observed upon depletion of ATR was
                 accompanied by the loss of Chk1 phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS:
                 ATR is a replication-dependent chromatin-binding protein, and
                 its association with chromatin is dependent on RNA synthesis
                 by DNA polymerase alpha. Depletion of ATR leads to premature
                 mitosis in the presence and absence of aphidicolin, indicating
                 that ATR is required for the DNA replication checkpoint.",

  abstract    = "Previous studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation of
                 human p53 on serine 15 contributes to protein stabilization
                 after DNA damage and that this is mediated by the ATM family
                 of kinases. However, cellular exposure to hypoxia does not
                 induce any detectable level of DNA lesions compared to
                 ionizing radiation, and the oxygen dependency of p53 protein
                 accumulation differs from that of HIF-1, the hypoxia-inducible
                 transcription factor. Here we show that, under severe hypoxic
                 conditions, p53 protein accumulates only in S phase and this
                 accumulation correlates with replication arrest. Inhibition of
                 ATR kinase activity substantially reduces hypoxia-induced
                 phosphorylation of p53 protein on serine 15 as well as p53
                 protein accumulation. Thus, hypoxia-induced cell growth arrest
                 is tightly linked to an ATR-signaling pathway that is required
                 for p53 modification and accumulation. These studies indicate
                 that the ATR kinase plays an important role during tumor
                 development in responding to hypoxia-induced replication
                 arrest, and hypoxic conditions could select for the loss of
                 key components of ATR-dependent checkpoint controls.",

                 3'-UTRs targeted by miRNAs alter the strength of miRNA binding
                 in a manner that affects the behavior of individual miRNAs.
                 The histone methyltransferase SET8 has been reported to
                 methylate TP53 and regulate genomic stability. We analyzed a
                 single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs16917496) within the miR-502
                 miRNA seed region for the 3'-UTR of SET8 in Chinese patients
                 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The SET8 CC genotype was
                 independently associated with longer postoperative survival in
                 patients with HCC by multivariate analysis (relative risk,
                 0.175; 95\% CI = 0.053-0.577; p = 0.004). The SET8 CC genotype
                 was associated with reduced SET8 protein levels based on the
                 immunostaining of 51 HCC tissue samples. We also found that
                 the low SET8 levels were associated with longer HCC survival.
                 Our data suggest that SET8 modifies HCC outcome by altering
                 its expression, which depends, at least in part, on its
                 binding affinity with miR-502. The analysis of genetic

                 predict the patients who will respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase
                 inhibitor (TKI) treatment. A recent study has suggested that
                 33\% of NSCLC showed primary tumor/metastasis discordance of
                 EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry analysis. We intended
                 to find out whether the EGFR mutations of primary lung cancers
                 are concordant to that of corresponding metastatic tumors.
                 MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed EGFR exons 18-21 from
                 paired primary and metastatic tumors in 67 lung cancer
                 patients who had not received TKI before tissues were sampled.
                 RESULTS: Using the direct sequencing method, 9 of 18 (50\%)
                 patients with EGFR mutation-positive primary lung tumors had
                 lost the mutations in metastases. For 26 patients who were
                 EGFR mutation positive in the metastatic tumors, 17 (65\%)
                 were negative in the primary tumors. We analyzed these paired
                 tissues with discrepant EGFR mutations by the Scorpion
                 Amplified Refractory Mutation System assay. Finally, the
                 discordant rate reached 27\% (18 of 67 cases). CONCLUSION:
                 EGFR mutations in primary lung tumors do not always reflect
                 the same situation in metastases. Analysis of EGFR mutations
                 in the primary lung tumor would be inadequate for planning the

                 changes in replication timing accompany key stages of

                 repressed chromatin and late replication that is conserved in
                 all eukaryotes. A long-standing question is whether
                 replication timing dictates the structure of chromatin or vice
                 versa. Mounting evidence supports a model in which replication
                 timing is both cause and consequence of chromatin structure by
                 providing a means to inherit chromatin states that, in turn,
                 regulate replication timing in the subsequent cell cycle.
                 Moreover, new findings relating aberrations in replication
                 timing to defects in centromere function, chromosome cohesion
                 and genome instability suggest that the role of replication

                 Rad3-related (ATR) activation and signaling. We provide
                 evidence that RAD50 is required for ATR activation in

                 ATR primarily responds to UV damage and replication stress,
                 yet may also function with ATM in the checkpoint response to
                 DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), although this is less clear.
                 Here, we show that atl-1 (Caenorhabditis elegans ATR) and
                 rad-5/clk-2 prevent mitotic catastrophe, function in the
                 S-phase checkpoint and also cooperate with atm-1 in the

                 induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis via the cep-1(p53)/egl-1
                 pathway. ATL-1 is recruited to stalled replication forks by
                 RPA-1 and functions upstream of rad-5/clk-2 in the S-phase

                 mre-11 is required for RPA-1 association and ATL-1 recruitment

                 and the distribution along chromosomes are still poorly
                 characterized. By integrative analysis of genome-wide binding
                 maps of 53 broadly selected chromatin components in Drosophila
                 cells, we show that the genome is segmented into five
                 principal chromatin types that are defined by unique yet
                 overlapping combinations of proteins and form domains that can
                 extend over > 100 kb. We identify a repressive chromatin type
                 that covers about half of the genome and lacks classic
                 heterochromatin markers. Furthermore, transcriptionally active
                 euchromatin consists of two types that differ in molecular
                 organization and H3K36 methylation and regulate distinct

                 a wide range of DNA processing proteins, including several
                 that regulate DNA damage response and repair. Small molecule
                 inhibitors that disrupt these protein-protein interactions are
                 therefore of interest as chemical probes of these critical DNA

                 play fundamental roles in regulating chromatin structure and
                 function. Extensive studies have established that acetylation
                 of specific lysine residues in the histone tails plays an
                 important role in transcriptional regulation. Besides
                 acetylation, recent studies have revealed that histone
                 methylation also has significant effects on heterochromatin
                 formation and transcriptional regulation. Histone methylation
                 occurs on specific arginine and lysine residues of histones H3
                 and H4. Thus far, only 2 residues on histone H4 are known to
                 be methylated. While H4-arginine 3 (H4-R3) methylation is
                 mediated by PRMT1, the enzyme(s) responsible for H4-lysine 20
                 (H4-K20) methylation is not known. RESULTS: To gain insight
                 into the function of H4-K20 methylation, we set out to
                 identify the enzyme responsible for this modification. We
                 purified and cloned a novel human SET domain-containing
                 protein, named SET8, which specifically methylates H4 at K20.
                 SET8 is a single subunit enzyme and prefers nucleosomal
                 substrates. We find that H4-K20 methylation occurs in a wide
                 range of higher eukaryotic organisms and that SET8 homologs
                 exist in C. elegans and Drosophila. We demonstrate that the
                 Drosophila SET8 homolog has the same substrate specificity as
                 its human counterpart. Importantly, disruption of SET8 in
                 Drosophila reduces levels of H4-K20 methylation in vivo and
                 results in lethality. Although H4-K20 methylation does not
                 correlate with gene activity, it appears to be regulated
                 during the cell cycle. CONCLUSIONS: We identified and
                 characterized an evolutionarily conserved nucleosomal
                 H4-K20-specific methyltransferase and demonstrated its
                 essential role in Drosophila development.",

                 nude mice with high metastatic potential (LCI-D20). METHODS:
                 After tumors were transplanted 11 days, mice were
                 intraperitoneally injected with CDA-II (1,800 mg/kg) for 20
                 days continuously. The tumor growth-inhibitory efficiency in
                 CDA-II treated groups was calculated. Proteins extracted from

                 identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time
                 of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Western blotting
                 (WB) was performed to verify the expression of certain

                 reaction (RT-PCR) was engaged to study the molecular mechanism
                 of the therapy. RESULTS: CDA-II suppressed the growth and
                 metastasis of tumor. The tumor growth-inhibitory efficiency
                 was 41.8\%. In total, 27 differentially expressed proteins
                 were identified, including HSP27, UGDH, CK8, Hsp60, ENOA and
                 AnxA5, with functions involved in oncogene expression and/or

                 RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the cancer related genes c-myc,

                 Our results demonstrate that CDA-II presence can change the
                 proteome profiling and favors of the tumor suppression in
                 LCI-D20 cell differentiation. Our results also suggest that

                 throughout the Drosophila genome and must be coordinated with
                 other ongoing nuclear processes such as transcription to
                 ensure genetic and epigenetic inheritance. Considerable
                 progress has been made toward understanding how chromatin
                 modifications regulate the transcription program; in contrast,
                 we know relatively little about the role of the chromatin
                 landscape in defining how start sites of DNA replication are
                 selected and regulated. Here, we describe the Drosophila
                 replication program in the context of the chromatin and
                 transcription landscape for multiple cell lines using data
                 generated by the modENCODE consortium. We find that while the
                 cell lines exhibit similar replication programs, there are
                 numerous cell line-specific differences that correlate with
                 changes in the chromatin architecture. We identify chromatin
                 features that are associated with replication timing, early
                 origin usage, and ORC binding. Primary sequence, activating
                 chromatin marks, and DNA-binding proteins (including chromatin
                 remodelers) contribute in an additive manner to specify
                 ORC-binding sites. We also generate accurate and predictive
                 models from the chromatin data to describe origin usage and
                 strength between cell lines. Multiple activating chromatin
                 modifications contribute to the function and relative strength
                 of replication origins, suggesting that the chromatin
                 environment does not regulate origins of replication as a
                 simple binary switch, but rather acts as a tunable rheostat to

                 Their discovery has led to novel findings spanning a number of
                 areas of genetics. Rare fragile sites are seen in a small
                 proportion of individuals and are inherited in a Mendelian
                 manner. Some, such as FRAXA in the FMR1 gene, are associated
                 with human genetic disorders, and their study led to the
                 identification of nucleotide-repeat expansion as a frequent
                 mutational mechanism in humans. In contrast, common fragile
                 sites are present in all individuals and represent the largest
                 class of fragile sites. Long considered an intriguing
                 component of chromosome structure, common fragile sites have
                 taken on novel significance as regions of the genome that are
                 particularly sensitive to replication stress and that are

                 damage. Here, we report that SET8 acts directly at DSBs during
                 the DNA damage response (DDR). SET8 accumulates at DSBs and is
                 enzymatically active at DSBs. Depletion of SET8 just prior to
                 the induction of DNA damage abrogates 53BP1's accumulation at
                 DSBs, suggesting that SET8 acts during DDR. SET8's occupancy
                 at DSBs is regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Finally,
                 SET8 is functionally required for efficient repair of DSBs
                 specifically via the non-homologous end-joining pathway
                 (NHEJ). Our findings reveal that SET8's active role during DDR

                 faithfully replicated to ensure that unaltered genomic
                 information is passed from one generation to the next. DNA
                 replication initiates from thousands of origins scattered
                 throughout the genome every cell cycle; however, not all
                 origins initiate replication at the same time. A vast amount
                 of work over the years indicates that different origins along
                 each eukaryotic chromosome are activated in early, middle or
                 late S phase. This temporal control of DNA replication is
                 referred to as the replication-timing program. The
                 replication-timing program represents a very stable epigenetic
                 feature of chromosomes. Recent evidence has indicated that the
                 replication-timing program can influence the spatial
                 distribution of mutagenic events such that certain regions of
                 the genome experience increased spontaneous mutagenesis
                 compared to surrounding regions. This influence has helped
                 shape the genomes of humans and other multicellular organisms
                 and can affect the distribution of mutations in somatic cells.
                 It is also becoming clear that the replication-timing program
                 is deregulated in many disease states, including cancer.
                 Aberrant DNA replication timing is associated with changes in
                 gene expression, changes in epigenetic modifications and an
                 increased frequency of structural rearrangements. Furthermore,
                 certain replication timing changes can directly lead to overt
                 genomic instability and may explain unique mutational
                 signatures that are present in cells that have undergone the
                 recently described processes of ``chromothripsis'' and
                 ``kataegis''. In this review, we will discuss how the normal
                 replication timing program, as well as how alterations to this
                 program, can contribute to the evolution of the genomic

                 Cre/loxP-based strategy to identify cis-acting elements that
                 control this replication-timing program on individual human
                 chromosomes. In this report, we show that rearrangements at a
                 complex locus at chromosome 15q24.3 result in delayed
                 replication and structural instability of human chromosome 15.
                 Characterization of this locus identified long, RNA
                 transcripts that are retained in the nucleus and form a
                 ``cloud'' on one homolog of chromosome 15. We also found that
                 this locus displays asynchronous replication that is
                 coordinated with other random monoallelic genes on chromosome
                 15. We have named this locus ASynchronous replication and
                 Autosomal RNA on chromosome 15, or ASAR15. Previously, we
                 found that disruption of the ASAR6 lincRNA gene results in
                 delayed replication, delayed mitotic condensation and
                 structural instability of human chromosome 6. Previous studies
                 in the mouse found that deletion of the Xist gene, from the X
                 chromosome in adult somatic cells, results in a delayed
                 replication and instability phenotype that is
                 indistinguishable from the phenotype caused by disruption of
                 either ASAR6 or ASAR15. In addition, delayed replication and
                 chromosome instability were detected following structural
                 rearrangement of many different human or mouse chromosomes.
                 These observations suggest that all mammalian chromosomes
                 contain similar cis-acting loci. Thus, under this scenario,
                 all mammalian chromosomes contain four distinct types of
                 essential cis-acting elements: origins, telomeres, centromeres
                 and ``inactivation/stability centers'', all functioning to

                 from Drosophila cultured cells and 0- to 13-h-old embryos.
                 Biochemical requirements for the in vitro cleavage are similar
                 to those previously described for the 3' end processing of
                 mammalian histone pre-mRNAs. Drosophila 3' end processing does
                 not require ATP and occurs in the presence of EDTA. However,
                 in contrast to mammalian processing, Drosophila processing
                 generates the final product ending four nucleotides after the
                 stem-loop. Cleavage of the Drosophila substrates is abolished
                 by depleting the extract of the Drosophila stem-loop binding
                 protein (dSLBP), indicating that both dSLBP and the stem-loop
                 structure in histone pre-mRNA are essential components of the
                 processing machinery. Recombinant dSLBP expressed in insect
                 cells by using the baculovirus system efficiently complements
                 the depleted extract. Only the RNA-binding domain plus the 17
                 amino acids at the C terminus of dSLBP are required for
                 processing. The full-length dSLBP expressed in insect cells is
                 quantitatively phosphorylated on four residues in the
                 C-terminal region. Dephosphorylation of the recombinant dSLBP
                 reduces processing activity. Human and Drosophila SLBPs are
                 not interchangeable and strongly inhibit processing in the
                 heterologous extracts. The RNA-binding domain of the dSLBP
                 does not substitute for the RNA-binding domain of the human
                 SLBP in histone pre-mRNA processing in mammalian extracts. In
                 addition to the stem-loop structure and dSLBP, 3' processing
                 in Drosophila nuclear extracts depends on the presence of a
                 short stretch of purines located ca. 20 nucleotides downstream
                 from the stem, and an Sm-reactive factor, most likely the

                 methylation uncouples Numb from p53, resulting in increased

                 stem-cell-niche model. We imaged UVB-induced death of specific
                 meristem cells in single and double Arabidopsis mutants to
                 elucidate cooperation among DNA translesion synthesis (TLS)
                 polymerases (Poleta, Polzeta) and DNA-damage-activated protein

                 progenitor (StPr) cells than in transiently amplifying cells.
                 Quantitative analyses of dose-response plots showed that
                 Poleta and Polzeta act redundantly to tolerate replication
                 blocks and that Polzeta-mediated TLS requires ATR. Deficient
                 TLS resulted in ATM-signaled death, which first appeared
                 10-14h post-UVB. Although ssDNA downstream of blocks was
                 likely cleaved into DSBs throughout S phase, death pathways
                 appeared to initiate late in S. In atm mutants death appeared
                 much later, likely signaled by a slow ATR-dependent pathway.
                 To bypass replication blocks, tissues may use TLS rather than
                 error-free pathways that could generate genomic aberrations.
                 Dynamic balances among ATR and ATM death-avoidance and

                 Rad3-related (ATR) coordinates much of the cellular response
                 to replication stress. The exact mechanisms by which ATR
                 regulates DNA synthesis in conditions of replication stress
                 are largely unknown, but this activity is critical for the
                 viability and proliferation of cancer cells, making ATR a
                 potential therapeutic target. Here we use selective ATR
                 inhibitors to demonstrate that acute inhibition of ATR kinase
                 activity yields rapid cell lethality, disrupts the timing of
                 replication initiation, slows replication elongation, and
                 induces fork collapse. We define the mechanism of this fork
                 collapse, which includes SLX4-dependent cleavage yielding
                 double-strand breaks and CtIP-dependent resection generating
                 excess single-stranded template and nascent DNA strands. Our
                 data suggest that the DNA substrates of these nucleases are
                 generated at least in part by the SMARCAL1 DNA translocase.
                 Properly regulated SMARCAL1 promotes stalled fork repair and
                 restart; however, unregulated SMARCAL1 contributes to fork
                 collapse when ATR is inactivated in both mammalian and Xenopus
                 systems. ATR phosphorylates SMARCAL1 on S652, thereby limiting
                 its fork regression activities and preventing aberrant fork
                 processing. Thus, phosphorylation of SMARCAL1 is one mechanism
                 by which ATR prevents fork collapse, promotes the completion
                 of DNA replication, and maintains genome integrity.",

                 unexpectedly discovered that normal cellular levels of
                 monomethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me1) were also
                 dependent on PR-Set7, but independent of its catalytic
                 activity. This observation suggested that PR-Set7 interacts
                 with an H3K9 monomethyltransferase to establish the previously
                 reported H4K20me1-H3K9me1 trans-tail 'histone code'. Here we
                 show that PR-Set7 specifically and directly binds the
                 C-terminus of the Riz1/PRDM2/KMT8 tumor suppressor and
                 demonstrate that the N-terminal PR/SET domain of Riz1

                 the repression of genes regulated by PR-Set7/H4K20me1.
                 Frameshift mutations resulting in a truncated Riz1 incapable
                 of binding PR-Set7 occur frequently in various aggressive

                 high-resolution confocal and deconvolution microscopy and

                 ``traits'' that influence biological phenotype in a fashion
                 that is not dependent on the underlying primary DNA sequence.
                 One setting in which epigenetics is likely to have a profound
                 influence on biological phenotype is during intrauterine
                 development. In this context there is a defined and critical
                 window during which balanced homeostasis is essential for
                 normal fetal growth and development. We have carried out a
                 detailed structural and functional analysis of the placental
                 epigenome at its maternal interface. Specifically, we
                 performed genome wide analysis of DNA methylation in samples
                 of chorionic villus (CVS) and maternal blood cells (MBC) using
                 both commercially available and custom designed microarrays.
                 We then compared these data with genome wide transcription
                 data for the same tissues. In addition to the discovery that
                 CVS genomes are significantly more hypomethylated than their
                 MBC counterparts, we identified numerous tissue-specific
                 differentially methylated regions (T-DMRs). We further
                 discovered that these T-DMRs are clustered spatially along the
                 genome and are enriched for genes with tissue-specific
                 biological functions. We identified unique patterns of DNA
                 methylation associated with distinct genomic structures such
                 as gene bodies, promoters and CpG islands and identified both
                 direct and inverse relationships between DNA methylation
                 levels and gene expression levels in gene bodies and promoters
                 respectively. Furthermore, we found that these relationships
                 were significantly associated with CpG content. We conclude
                 that the early gestational placental DNA methylome is highly
                 organized and is significantly and globally associated with
                 transcription. These data provide a unique insight into the
                 structural and regulatory characteristics of the placental
                 epigenome at its maternal interface and will drive future

                 is strongly associated with hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in
                 patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), which might affect
                 the efficacy of antiviral therapy. Aim To investigate
                 retrospectively the impact of insulin resistance on treatment
                 response in Chinese genotype 1 CHC patients receiving a
                 24-week course therapy with peginterferon alpha-2b/ribavirin.
                 METHODS: A total of 133 biopsy-proven CHC patients were
                 enrolled for analyses. Insulin resistance was evaluated by
                 homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).
                 Hepatic fibrosis was graded by the METAVIR scoring system.
                 RESULTS: Mean HOMA-IR progressively elevated along with the
                 severity of hepatic fibrosis (F1-F2 fibrosis: 2.55 +/- 0.16
                 vs. F3-F4 fibrosis: 3.61 +/- 0.20, P or=600,000 IU/mL; 64.4\%
                 vs. 35.6\%, P = 0.038). In addition, patients without SVR had
                 significantly higher plasma levels of insulin (15.03 +/- 0.89
                 vs. 10.19 +/- 0.55 microU/mL, P < 0.001) and HOMA-IR values
                 (3.76 +/- 0.23 vs. 2.50 +/- 0.15, P < 0.001). Multivariate
                 analyses showed that F1-F2 fibrosis (odds ratio: 4.49, P =
                 0.001), HOMA-IR < 2 (odds ratio: 7.15, P = 0.005) and

                 roles in many biological functions. Specifically, histone
                 H4-K20 methylation is critical for DNA synthesis and repair.
                 However, little is known about how these functions are
                 regulated by the upstream stimuli. Here, we identify a
                 tyrosine phosphorylation site at Y72 of histone H4, which
                 facilitates recruitment of histone methyltransferases
                 (HMTases), SET8 and SUV4-20H, to enhance its K20 methylation,
                 thereby promoting DNA synthesis and repair.
                 Phosphorylation-defective histone H4 mutant is deficient in
                 K20 methylation, leading to reduced DNA synthesis, delayed
                 cell cycle progression, and decreased DNA repair ability.

                 monomethylation, and the Ki-67 proliferation marker. These

                 their exact etiology is poorly understood. NEK8/NPHP9 is a

                 humans and mice, nephronophthisis (NPHP) and polycystic kidney

                 ATR-mediated replication stress response. Cells lacking NEK8
                 form spontaneous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that further
                 accumulate when replication forks stall, and they exhibit
                 reduced fork rates, unscheduled origin firing, and increased
                 replication fork collapse. NEK8 suppresses DSB formation by
                 limiting cyclin A-associated CDK activity. Strikingly, a
                 mutation in NEK8 that is associated with renal ciliopathies
                 affects its genome maintenance functions. Moreover, kidneys of

                 ventilation (PMV) tend to become reservoirs of antimicrobial
                 resistance. We assessed antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms
                 in the respiratory tracts of patients receiving PMV. METHODS:
                 Over a 6-month period, the microorganisms from tracheal
                 aspirates of PMV patients with lower airway infection were
                 analyzed. RESULTS: Antimicrobial use was greatest during the
                 acute critical stage of respiratory failure. Antimicrobial
                 resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae
                 peaked during the fourth to 15th weeks of PMV.
                 Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) developed
                 rapidly during the first 3 weeks of PMV. The acquisition of
                 multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa and MRSA were significantly
                 correlated with previous exposure to ceftazidime (odds ratio
                 [OR] = 121.3 and 72.5; P = .01 and .01, respectively). The
                 rise of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii was
                 significantly correlated with previous exposure to
                 piperacillin/tazobactam (OR = 26.81; P = .02) and imipenem (OR
                 = 16.91; P = .03). Using univariate and multivariate logistic
                 regression models, the lower respiratory tract infections with
                 multidrug-resistant microorganisms were independently
                 associated with increased 6-month mortality (OR = 3.41; P <
                 .01). CONCLUSION: In patients receiving PMV, lower respiratory
                 tract infection with multidrug-resistant microorganisms is
                 common and is associated with higher mortality.",

                 to the membrane-spanning domain of the gp41 transmembrane
                 protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 has been
                 proposed as being important for the surface envelope (Env)
                 glycoprotein's association with lipid rafts and gp41-mediated
                 membrane fusion. Here we employed substitution and deletion
                 mutagenesis to understand the role of this motif in the virus
                 life cycle. None of the mutants examined affected the
                 synthesis, precursor processing, CD4 binding, oligomerization,
                 or cell surface expression of the Env, nor did they alter Env
                 incorporation into the virus. All of the mutants, particularly
                 the DeltaYI, DeltaIK, and DeltaLWYIK mutants, in which the
                 indicated residues were deleted, exhibited greatly reduced
                 one-cycle viral replication and the Env trans-complementation
                 ability. All of these deletion mutant proteins were still
                 localized in the lipid rafts. With the exception of the
                 Trp-to-Ala (WA) mutant, which exhibited reduced viral
                 infectivity albeit with normal membrane fusion, all mutants
                 displayed loss of some or almost all of the membrane fusion
                 ability. Although these deletion mutants partially inhibited
                 in trans wild-type (WT) Env-mediated fusion, they were more
                 effective in dominantly interfering with WT Env-mediated viral
                 entry when coexpressed with the WT Env, implying a role of
                 this motif in postfusion events as well. Both T20 and L43L
                 peptides derived from the two gp41 extracellular C- and
                 N-terminal alpha-helical heptad repeats, respectively,
                 inhibited WT and DeltaLWYIK Env-mediated viral entry with
                 comparable efficacies. Biotin-tagged T20 effectively captured
                 both the fusion-active, prehairpin intermediates of WT and
                 mutant gp41 upon CD4 activation. Env without the deletion of
                 the LWYIK motif still effectively mediated lipid mixing but
                 inhibited content mixing. Our study demonstrates that the
                 immediate membrane-proximal LWYIK motif acts as a unique and
                 distinct determinant located in the gp41 C-terminal ectodomain

                 RESULTS: BLI revealed a drastically different cell survival

                 complexes, was down-regulated in human lung adenocarcinomas.
                 OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical significance of CLDN1
                 expression in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and its role
                 in cancer invasion and metastasis. METHODS: We examined the
                 CLDN1 mRNA expression in tumor specimens from 64 patients with
                 lung adenocarcinoma and protein expression by
                 immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort of 67 patients
                 with lung adenocarcinoma. CLDN1 functions in cancer cell
                 migration, invasion, and metastatic colonization were studied
                 by overexpression and knockdown of CLDN1. Affymetrix
                 microarrays were performed to identify gene expression changes
                 associated with CLDN1 overexpression. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN
                 RESULTS: We found that low-CLDN1 mRNA expression had shorter
                 overall survival (P = 0.027, log-rank test) in 64 patients
                 with lung adenocarcinoma, and we confirmed by
                 immunohistochemistry that low CLDN1 expression had shorter
                 overall survival (P = 0.024, log-rank test) in an independent
                 cohort of 67 patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Overexpression
                 of CLDN1 inhibited cancer cell dissociation in time-lapse
                 imaging of wound healing, and suppressed cancer cell
                 migration, invasion, and metastasis. Knockdown CLDN1
                 expression increased cancer cell invasive and metastatic
                 abilities. Affymetrix microarrays identified a panel of genes
                 altered by CLDN1 overexpression. CLDN1 increased expressions
                 of cancer invasion/metastasis suppressors (e.g., connective
                 tissue growth factor [CTGF], thrombospondin 1 [THBS1], deleted
                 in liver cancer 1 [DLC1], occludin [OCLN], zona occludens 1
                 [ZO-1]) and suppressed expressions of invasion/metastasis
                 enhancers (e.g., secreted phosphoprotein 1 [SPP1], cut-like
                 homeobox 1 [CUTL1], transforming growth factor alpha
                 [TGF-alpha], solute carrier family 2 [faciliated glucose
                 transporter] member 3 [SLC2A3], placental growth factor
                 [PGF]), supporting a role for CLDN1 as an invasion and
                 metastasis suppressor. CONCLUSIONS: CLDN1 is a cancer
                 invasion/metastasis suppressor. CLDN1 is also a useful
                 prognostic predictor and potential drug treatment target for

                 verify the experimental findings. Between-group difference in
                 FA was observed in the GCC and RACR before spatial
                 normalization (P<.00001). Interpolation reduced the measured
                 FA values significantly (P<.00001 for both algorithms) but did
                 not affect the group difference in the GCC. For the RACR, the

  abstract    = "Chromosomal abnormalities are frequently caused by problems
                 encountered during DNA replication. Although the ATR-Chk1
                 pathway has previously been implicated in preventing the
                 collapse of stalled replication forks into double-strand
                 breaks (DSB), the importance of the response to fork collapse
                 in ATR-deficient cells has not been well characterized.
                 Herein, we demonstrate that, upon stalled replication, ATR
                 deficiency leads to the phosphorylation of H2AX by ATM and
                 DNA-PKcs and to the focal accumulation of Rad51, a marker of
                 homologous recombination and fork restart. Because H2AX has
                 been shown to play a facilitative role in homologous
                 recombination, we hypothesized that H2AX participates in
                 Rad51-mediated suppression of DSBs generated in the absence of
                 ATR. Consistent with this model, increased Rad51 focal
                 accumulation in ATR-deficient cells is largely dependent on
                 H2AX, and dual deficiencies in ATR and H2AX lead to
                 synergistic increases in chromatid breaks and translocations.
                 Importantly, the ATM and DNA-PK phosphorylation site on H2AX
                 (Ser(139)) is required for genome stabilization in the absence
                 of ATR; therefore, phosphorylation of H2AX by ATM and DNA-PKcs
                 plays a pivotal role in suppressing DSBs during DNA synthesis
                 in instances of ATR pathway failure. These results imply that
                 ATR-dependent fork stabilization and
                 H2AX/ATM/DNA-PKcs-dependent restart pathways cooperatively
                 suppress double-strand breaks as a layered response network

                 genomewide fork stalling followed by chromosome breakage.
                 Breaks do not result from stochastic collapse of stalled forks
                 or other incidental lesions; instead, they occur in specific
                 regions of the genome during a G2 chromosomal transition.
                 Break regions are found to be genetically encoded replication
                 slow zones (RSZs), a newly discovered yeast chromosomal
                 determinant. Thus, Mec1 has important functions in normal S
                 phase and the genome instability of mec1 (and, analogously,
                 ATR-/-) mutants stems from defects in these basic roles.",

                 during cell-cycle progression is crucial for genomic
                 stability. During G2 and mitosis, Set8 catalyzes
                 monomethylation of histone H4 on lysine 20 (H4K20me1), which
                 promotes chromatin compaction. Set8 levels decline in S phase,
                 but why and how this occurs is unclear. Here, we show that
                 Set8 is targeted for proteolysis in S phase and in response to
                 DNA damage by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, CRL4(Cdt2). Set8
                 ubiquitylation occurs on chromatin and is coupled to DNA
                 replication via a specific degron in Set8 that binds PCNA.
                 Inactivation of CRL4(Cdt2) leads to Set8 stabilization and
                 aberrant H4K20me1 accumulation in replicating cells. Transient
                 S phase expression of a Set8 mutant lacking the degron
                 promotes premature H4K20me1 accumulation and chromatin
                 compaction, and triggers a checkpoint-mediated G2 arrest.
                 Thus, CRL4(Cdt2)-dependent destruction of Set8 in S phase

                 mutation of dLsm11 that prevents dFLASH binding but does not

                 by methylation plays an important role in tumorigenesis. In
                 this study, we investigated the nuclear expression of H3K4me3,
                 H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 in early-stage colon cancer in relation
                 to clinical outcome. METHODS: Tumor tissue cores of 254 TNM
                 stage I-III colorectal cancer patients were
                 immunohistochemically stained for H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and
                 H4K20me3 and scored using the semi-automated Ariol system. Cox
                 proportional hazard trend analyses were performed to assess
                 the prognostic value of the combined markers with respect to
                 patient survival and tumor recurrence. RESULTS: The histone
                 methylation markers only showed prognostic value in
                 early-stage (TNM stage I and II) colon cancer. Therefore, only
                 this patient set (n = 121) was used for further statistical
                 analyses. Low nuclear expression of H3K4me3, and high
                 expression of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 were associated with good
                 prognosis. In combined marker analyses, the patient group
                 showing most favorable expression (low H3K4me3, high H3K9me3
                 and high H4K20me3) was associated with the best prognosis.
                 Multivariate trend analyses showed significantly increased
                 hazard ratios (HR) for each additional marker showing
                 unfavorable expression, as compared to the ``all favorable''
                 reference group. The HR for disease-free survival was 3.81
                 (1.72-8.45; p = 0.001), for locoregional recurrence-free
                 survival 2.86 (1.59-5.13; p < 0.001) and for distant
                 recurrence-free survival 2.94 (1.66-5.22; p < 0.001).
                 CONCLUSIONS: Combined nuclear expression of histone
                 modifications H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 is prognostic in
                 early-stage colon cancer. The combination of expression of the
                 three histone modifications provides better stratification of
                 patient groups as compared to the individual markers and
                 provides a good risk assessment for each patient group.",

                 further methylation by Suv4-20h1/h2. PR-Set7 is required for
                 proper cell cycle progression and is subject to degradation by
                 the CRL4(Cdt2) ubiquitin ligase complex as a function of the
                 cell cycle and DNA damage. This report demonstrates that
                 PR-Set7 is an important downstream effector of CRL4(Cdt2)
                 function during origin of DNA replication licensing, dependent
                 on Suv4-20h1/2 activity. Aberrant rereplication correlates
                 with decreased levels of H4K20me1 and increased levels of
                 H4K20 trimethylation (H4K20me3). Expression of a

                 PR-Set7 targeting to an artificial locus results in
                 recruitment of the origin recognition complex (ORC) in a
                 manner dependent on Suv4-20h and H4K20me3. Consistent with
                 this, H4K20 methylation status plays a direct role in
                 recruiting ORC through the binding properties of ORC1 and
                 ORCA/LRWD1. Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation

                 The Werner syndrome protein (WRN) is implicated in the
                 recovery of stalled replication forks, and although an
                 ATR/ATM-dependent phosphorylation of WRN was observed after
                 replication arrest, the function of such modifications during
                 the response to perturbed replication is not yet appreciated.
                 Here, we report that WRN is directly phosphorylated by ATR at
                 multiple C-terminal S/TQ residues. Suppression of ATR-mediated
                 phosphorylation of WRN prevents proper accumulation of WRN in

                 stress also depends on the Mec1 kinase, which activates the
                 DNA replication checkpoint in an Mrc1-dependent manner in
                 response to fork arrest. Although the Mec1 and Rad52 pathways

                 recognition complex (ORC), which coordinates Mcm2-7 helicase
                 loading to form the prereplicative complex (pre-RC). Although
                 pre-RC assembly is well characterized in vitro, the process is

                 surrounding replication origins. To reveal how the chromatin
                 architecture modulates origin selection and activation, we
                 ``footprinted'' nucleosomes, transcription factors, and

                 footprint at 269 origins in G2. A separate class of
                 inefficient origins exhibited protein occupancy only in G1,
                 suggesting that stable ORC chromatin association in G2 is a
                 determinant of origin efficiency. G1 nucleosome remodeling
                 concomitant with pre-RC assembly expanded the origin
                 nucleosome-free region and enhanced activation efficiency.
                 Finally, the local chromatin environment restricts the loading
                 of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer either upstream of or downstream

                 ORC-dependent loading of the Mcm2-7 helicase complex onto

                 excess Mcm2-7 complexes exhibit little co-localization with

                 We found that in the absence of cyclin E/Cdk2 activity, there
                 was a 10-fold decrease in chromatin-associated Mcm2-7 relative

              the rare codon bias of the KRAS gene on de novo tumorigenesis, we
              introduced synonymous mutations that converted rare codons into
              common codons in exon 3 of the Kras gene in mice. Compared with
              control animals, mice with at least 1 copy of this Kras(ex3op)
              allele had fewer tumors following carcinogen exposure, and this
              allele was mutated less often, with weaker oncogenic mutations in
              these tumors. This reduction in tumorigenesis was attributable to
              higher expression of the Kras(ex3op) allele, which induced growth
              arrest when oncogenic and exhibited tumor-suppressive activity
              when not mutated. Together, our data indicate that the inherent
              rare codon bias of KRAS plays an integral role in tumorigenesis.",
