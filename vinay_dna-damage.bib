abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Rad54 protein participates in the recombinational repair of double-strand DNA breaks together with the Rad51, Rad52, Rad55 and Rad57 proteins. In vitro, Rad54 interacts with Rad51 and stimulates DNA strand exchange promoted by Rad51 protein. Rad54 is a SWI2/SNF2-related protein that possesses double-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity and changes DNA topology in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner. Here we show that Rad54 catalyzes bidirectional nucleosome redistribution by sliding nucleosomes along DNA. Nucleosome redistribution is greatly stimulated by the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament but does not require the presence of homologous single-stranded DNA within the filament. On the basis of these data, we propose that Rad54 facilitates chromatin remodeling and, perhaps more generally, protein clearing at the homology search step of genetic recombination.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic cell is faced with more than 10 000 various kinds of DNA lesions per day. Failure to repair such lesions can lead to mutations, genomic instability, or cell death. Therefore, cells have developed 5 major repair pathways in which different kinds of DNA damage can be detected and repaired: homologous recombination, nonhomologous end joining, nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair. However, the efficient repair of DNA damage is complicated by the fact that the genomic DNA is packaged through histone and nonhistone proteins into chromatin, a highly condensed structure that hinders DNA accessibility and its subsequent repair. Therefore, the cellular repair machinery has to circumvent this natural barrier to gain access to the damaged site in a timely manner. Repair of DNA lesions in the context of chromatin occurs with the assistance of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes and histone-modifying enzymes, which allow access of the necessary repair factors to the lesion. Here we review recent studies that elucidate the interplay between chromatin modifiers / remodelers and the major DNA repair pathways.},

abstract = {Chromosomes are folded into cells in a nonrandom fashion, with particular genetic loci occupying distinct spatial regions. This observation raises the question of whether the spatial organization of a chromosome governs its functions, such as recombination or transcription. We consider this general question in the specific context of mating-type switching in budding yeast, which is a model system for homologous recombination. Mating-type switching is induced by a DNA double-strand break (DSB) at the MAT locus on chromosome III, followed by homologous recombination between the cut MAT locus and one of two donor loci (HML$\alpha$ and HMRa), located on the same chromosome. Previous studies have suggested that in MATa cells after the DSB is induced chromosome III undergoes refolding, which directs the MAT locus to recombine with HML$\alpha$. Here, we propose a quantitative model of mating-type switching predicated on the assumption of DSB-induced chromosome refolding, which also takes into account the previously measured stochastic dynamics and polymer nature of yeast chromosomes. Using quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we measure changes in the distance between the donor (HML$\alpha$) and MAT loci after the DSB and find agreement with the theory. Predictions of the theory also agree with measurements of changes in the use of HML$\alpha$ as the donor, when we perturb the refolding of chromosome III. These results establish refolding of yeast chromosome III as a key driving force in MAT switching and provide an example of a cell regulating the spatial organization of its chromosome so as to direct homology search during recombination.},

abstract = {Cadmium is a transition metal ion that is highly toxic in biological systems. Although relatively rare in the Earth's crust, anthropogenic release of cadmium since industrialization has increased biogeochemical cycling and the abundance of the ion in the biosphere. Despite this, the molecular basis of its toxicity remains unclear. Here we combine metal-accumulation assays, high-resolution structural data and biochemical analyses to show that cadmium toxicity, in Streptococcus pneumoniae, occurs via perturbation of first row transition metal ion homeostasis. We show that cadmium uptake reduces the millimolar cellular accumulation of manganese and zinc, and thereby increases sensitivity to oxidative stress. Despite this, high cellular concentrations of cadmium ({\~{}}17 mM) are tolerated, with negligible impact on growth or sensitivity to oxidative stress, when manganese and glutathione are abundant. Collectively, this work provides insight into the molecular basis of cadmium toxicity in prokaryotes, and the connection between cadmium accumulation and oxidative stress.},

The detection of human ATM protein at site-specific DSBs required functional NBS1 protein, ATM kinase activity and ATM autophosphorylation on Ser 1981. DSB formation led to the localized disruption of nucleosomes, a process that depended on both functional NBS1 and ATM. These two proteins were also required for efficient recruitment of the repair cofactor XRCC4 to DSBs, and for efficient DSB repair. These results demonstrate the functional importance of ATM kinase activity and phosphorylation in the response to DSBs, and support a model in which ordered chromatin structure changes that occur after DNA breakage depend on functional NBS1 and ATM, and facilitate DNA DSB repair.},

abstract = {A very early step in the response of mammalian cells to DNA double-strand breaks is the phosphorylation of histone H2AX at serine 139 at the sites of DNA damage. Although the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase), ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), have all been implicated in H2AX phosphorylation, the specific kinase involved has not yet been identified. To definitively identify the specific kinase(s) that phosphorylates H2AX in vivo, we have utilized DNA-PKcs-/- and Atm-/- cell lines and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We find that H2AX phosphorylation and nuclear focus formation are normal in DNA-PKcs-/- cells and severely compromised in Atm-/- cells. We also find that ATM can phosphorylate H2AX in vitro and that ectopic expression of ATM in Atm-/- fibroblasts restores H2AX phosphorylation in vivo. The minimal H2AX phosphorylation in Atm-/- fibroblasts can be abolished by low concentrations of wortmannin suggesting that DNA-PK, rather than ATR, is responsible for low levels of H2AX phosphorylation in the absence of ATM. Our results clearly establish ATM as the major kinase involved in the phosphorylation of H2AX and suggest that ATM is one of the earliest kinases to be activated in the cellular response to double-strand breaks.},

However, this constraint also allows nucleosomes and other chromatin components to actively participate in the regulation of transcription, chromosome segregation, DNA replication, and DNA repair. To enable dynamic access to packaged DNA and to tailor nucleosome composition in chromosomal regions, cells have evolved a set of specialized chromatin remodeling complexes (remodelers). Remodelers use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move, destabilize, eject, or restructure nucleosomes. Here, we address many aspects of remodeler biology: their targeting, mechanism, regulation, shared and unique properties, and specialization for particular biological processes. We also address roles for remodelers in development, cancer, and human syndromes.},

MRN also plays a role in the response to DSBs created by DNA damage. Hypomorphic mutations in Mre11 (which causes an ataxia-telangiectasia-like disease [ATLD]) and mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) gene lead to defects in handling damaged DNA and to similar clinical and cellular phenotypes. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we have designed a simple assay to define the biochemistry of Mre11. MRN is required for efficient activation of the DNA damage response induced by DSBs. We isolated a high molecular weight DNA damage signaling complex that includes MRN, damaged DNA molecules, and activated ATM. Complex formation is partially dependent upon Zn(2+) and requires an intact Mre11 C-terminal domain that is deleted in some ATLD patients. The ATLD truncation can still perform the role of Mre11 during replication. Our work demonstrates the role of Mre11 in assembling DNA damage signaling centers that are reminiscent of irradiation-induced foci. It also provides a molecular explanation for the similarities between ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) and ATLD.},

abstract = {Homology-directed repair is a powerful mechanism for maintaining and altering genomic structure. We asked how chromatin structure contributes to the use of homologous sequences as donors for repair using the chicken B cell line DT40 as a model. In DT40, immunoglobulin genes undergo regulated sequence diversification by gene conversion templated by pseudogene donors. We found that the immunoglobulin Vlambda pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin. We directly demonstrated the importance of chromatin structure for gene conversion, using a regulatable experimental system in which the heterochromatin protein HP1 (Drosophila melanogaster Su[var]205), expressed as a fusion to Escherichia coli lactose repressor, is tethered to polymerized lactose operators integrated within the pseudo-Vlambda donor array. Tethered HP1 diminished histone acetylation within the pseudo-Vlambda array, and altered the outcome of Vlambda diversification, so that nontemplated mutations rather than templated mutations predominated. Thus, chromatin structure regulates homology-directed repair. These results suggest that histone modifications may contribute to maintaining genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences.},

abstract = {Layered on top of information conveyed by DNA sequence and chromatin are higher order structures that encompass portions of chromosomes, entire chromosomes, and even whole genomes. Interphase chromosomes are not positioned randomly within the nucleus, but instead adopt preferred conformations. Disparate DNA elements co-localize into functionally defined aggregates or 'factories' for transcription and DNA replication. In budding yeast, Drosophila and many other eukaryotes, chromosomes adopt a Rabl configuration, with arms extending from centromeres adjacent to the spindle pole body to telomeres that abut the nuclear envelope. Nonetheless, the topologies and spatial relationships of chromosomes remain poorly understood. Here we developed a method to globally capture intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions, and applied it to generate a map at kilobase resolution of the haploid genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The map recapitulates known features of genome organization, thereby validating the method, and identifies new features. Extensive regional and higher order folding of individual chromosomes is observed. Chromosome XII exhibits a striking conformation that implicates the nucleolus as a formidable barrier to interaction between DNA sequences at either end. Inter-chromosomal contacts are anchored by centromeres and include interactions among transfer RNA genes, among origins of early DNA replication and among sites where chromosomal breakpoints occur. Finally, we constructed a three-dimensional model of the yeast genome. Our findings provide a glimpse of the interface between the form and function of a eukaryotic genome.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae requires manganese for colonization of the human host, but the underlying molecular basis for this requirement has not been elucidated. Recently, it was shown that zinc could compromise manganese uptake and that zinc levels increased during infection by S. pneumoniae in all the niches that it colonized. Here we show, by quantitative means, that extracellular zinc acts in a dose dependent manner to competitively inhibit manganese uptake by S. pneumoniae, with an EC50 of 30.2 µM for zinc in cation-defined media. By exploiting the ability to directly manipulate S. pneumoniae accumulation of manganese, we analyzed the connection between manganese and superoxide dismutase (SodA), a primary source of protection for S. pneumoniae against oxidative stress. We show that manganese starvation led to a decrease in sodA transcription indicating that expression of sodA was regulated through an unknown manganese responsive pathway. Intriguingly, examination of recombinant SodA revealed that the enzyme was potentially a cambialistic superoxide dismutase with an iron/manganese cofactor. SodA was also shown to provide the majority of protection against oxidative stress as a S. pneumoniae $\Delta$sodA mutant strain was found to be hypersensitive to oxidative stress, despite having wild-type manganese levels, indicating that the metal ion alone was not sufficiently protective. Collectively, these results provide a quantitative assessment of the competitive effect of zinc upon manganese uptake and provide a molecular basis for how extracellular zinc exerts a 'toxic' effect on bacterial pathogens, such as S. pneumoniae.},

abstract = {DNA repair must take place within the context of chromatin, and it is therefore not surprising that many aspects of both chromatin components and proteins that modify chromatin have been implicated in this process. One of the best-characterized chromatin modification events in DNA-damage responses is the phosphorylation of the SQ motif found in histone H2A or the H2AX histone variant in higher eukaryotes. This modification is an early response to the induction of DNA damage, and occurs in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms, suggesting an important conserved function. One function that histone modifications can have is to provide a unique binding site for interacting factors. Here, we review the proteins and protein complexes that have been identified as H2AS129ph (budding yeast) or H2AXS139ph (human) binding partners and discuss the implications of these interactions.},

abstract = {Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) represent the two main pathways for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). During the G2 phase of the mammalian cell cycle, both processes can operate and chromatin structure is one important factor which determines DSB repair pathway choice. ATM facilitates the repair of heterochromatic DSBs by phosphorylating and inactivating the heterochromatin building factor KAP-1, leading to local chromatin relaxation. Here, we show that ATM accumulation and activity is strongly diminished at DSBs undergoing end-resection during HR. Such DSBs remain unrepaired in cells devoid of the HR factors BRCA2, XRCC3 or RAD51. Strikingly, depletion of KAP-1 or expression of phospho-mimic KAP-1 allows repair of resected DSBs in the absence of BRCA2, XRCC3 or RAD51 by an erroneous PARP-dependent alt-NHEJ process. We suggest that DSBs in heterochromatin elicit initial local heterochromatin relaxation which is reversed during HR due to the release of ATM from resection break ends. The restored heterochromatic structure facilitates HR and prevents usage of error-prone alternative processes.},

abstract = {Mating type in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is determined by two nonhomologous alleles, MATa and MAT$\alpha$. These sequences encode regulators of the two different haploid mating types and of the diploids formed by their conjugation. Analysis of the MATa1, MAT$\alpha$1, and MAT$\alpha$2 alleles provided one of the earliest models of cell-type specification by transcriptional activators and repressors. Remarkably, homothallic yeast cells can switch their mating type as often as every generation by a highly choreographed, site-specific homologous recombination event that replaces one MAT allele with different DNA sequences encoding the opposite MAT allele. This replacement process involves the participation of two intact but unexpressed copies of mating-type information at the heterochromatic loci, HML$\alpha$ and HMRa, which are located at opposite ends of the same chromosome-encoding MAT. The study of MAT switching has yielded important insights into the control of cell lineage, the silencing of gene expression, the formation of heterochromatin, and the regulation of accessibility of the donor sequences. Real-time analysis of MAT switching has provided the most detailed description of the molecular events that occur during the homologous recombinational repair of a programmed double-strand chromosome break.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

This checkpoint triggers cell cycle arrest, providing time for the cell to repair damaged chromosomes before entering mitosis. This mechanism helps prevent the segregation of damaged or mutated chromosomes and thus promotes genomic stability. Recent work has elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying several critical steps in checkpoint activation, notably the recruitment of the upstream checkpoint kinases of the ATM and ATR families to different damaged DNA structures and the molecular events through which these kinases activate their effectors. Chromatin modification has emerged as one important component of checkpoint activation and maintenance. Following DNA repair, the checkpoint pathway is inactivated in a process termed recovery. A related but genetically distinct process, adaptation, controls cell cycle re-entry in the face of unrepairable damage.},

Taking advantage of the massive flow of ribosomal proteins through the nucleus during maturation, a protein of the large subunit was chosen as the anchor. Addition of rapamycin, due to formation of the ternary complex, composed of the anchor, rapamycin, and the target, then results in the rapid depletion of the target from the nucleus. All 43 tested genes displayed on rapamycin plates the expected defective growth phenotype. In addition, when examined functionally, specific mutant phenotypes were obtained within minutes. These are genes involved in protein import, RNA export, transcription, sister chromatid cohesion, and gene silencing.

abstract = {The ability to induce synchronously a single site-specific double-strand break (DSB) in a budding yeast chromosome has made it possible to monitor the kinetics and genetic requirements of many molecular steps during DSB repair. Special attention has been paid to the switching of mating-type genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a process initiated by the HO endonuclease by cleaving the MAT locus. A DSB in MATa is repaired by homologous recombination--specifically, by gene conversion--using a heterochromatic donor, HML$\alpha$. Repair results in the replacement of the a-specific sequences (Ya) by Y$\alpha$ and switching from MATa to MAT$\alpha$. We report that MAT switching requires the DNA replication factor Dpb11, although it does not require the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase or the Mcm and Cdc45 helicase components. Using Southern blot, PCR, and ChIP analysis of samples collected every 10 min, we extend previous studies of this process to identify the times for the loading of Rad51 recombinase protein onto the DSB ends at MAT, the subsequent strand invasion by the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament into the donor sequences, the initiation of new DNA synthesis, and the removal of the nonhomologous Y sequences. In addition we report evidence for the transient displacement of well-positioned nucleosomes in the HML donor locus during strand invasion.},

It was unclear what, if anything, distinguishes the two potential sites of repair. Here, we characterize and distinguish thetwo binding sites. First, DSB-pore interaction occurs independently of cell-cycle phase and requires neither the chromatin remodeler INO80 nor recombinase Rad51 activity. In contrast, Mps3 binding is Sand G2 phase specific and requires both factors. SWR1-dependent incorporation of Htz1 (H2A.Z) is necessary for break relocation to either site in both G1- and S-phase cells. Importantly, functional assays indicate that mutations in the two sites have additive repair defects, arguing that the two perinuclear anchorage sites define distinct survival pathways. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Chromatin acts as a key regulator of DNA-related processes such as DNA damage repair. Although ChIP-chip is a powerful technique to provide high-resolution maps of protein-genome interactions, its use to study DNA double strand break (DSB) repair has been hindered by the limitations of the available damage induction methods. We have developed a human cell line that permits induction of multiple DSBs randomly distributed and unambiguously positioned within the genome. Using this system, we have generated the first genome-wide mapping of gammaH2AX around DSBs. We found that all DSBs trigger large gammaH2AX domains, which spread out from the DSB in a bidirectional, discontinuous and not necessarily symmetrical manner. The distribution of gammaH2AX within domains is influenced by gene transcription, as parallel mappings of RNA Polymerase II and strand-specific expression showed that gammaH2AX does not propagate on active genes. In addition, we showed that transcription is accurately maintained within gammaH2AX domains, indicating that mechanisms may exist to protect gene transcription from gammaH2AX spreading and from the chromatin rearrangements induced by DSBs.},

abstract = {Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins including transcription factors (TFs) are key determinants of gene regulation and chromatin architecture. TF profiling is commonly carried out by formaldehyde cross-linking and sonication followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (X-ChIP). We describe a method to profile TF binding at high resolution without cross-linking. We begin with micrococcal nuclease-digested non-cross-linked chromatin and then perform affinity purification of TFs and paired-end sequencing. The resulting occupied regions of genomes from affinity-purified naturally isolated chromatin (ORGANIC) profiles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abf1 and Reb1 provide high-resolution maps that are accurate, as defined by the presence of known TF consensus motifs in identified binding sites, that are not biased toward accessible chromatin and that do not require input normalization. We profiled Drosophila melanogaster GAGA factor and Pipsqueak to test ORGANIC performance on larger genomes. Our results suggest that ORGANIC profiling is a widely applicable high-resolution method for sensitive and specific profiling of direct protein-DNA interactions.},

abstract = {One of the earliest marks of a double-strand break (DSB) in eukaryotes is serine phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX at the carboxy-terminal SQE motif to create gammaH2AX-containing nucleosomes. Budding-yeast histone H2A is phosphorylated in a similar manner by the checkpoint kinases Tel1 and Mec1 (ref. 2; orthologous to mammalian ATM and ATR, respectively) over a 50-kilobase region surrounding the DSB. This modification is important for recruiting numerous DSB-recognition and repair factors to the break site, including DNA damage checkpoint proteins, chromatin remodellers and cohesins. Multiple mechanisms for eliminating gammaH2AX as DNA repair completes are possible, including removal by histone exchange followed potentially by degradation, or, alternatively, dephosphorylation. Here we describe a three-protein complex (HTP-C, for histone H2A phosphatase complex) containing the phosphatase Pph3 that regulates the phosphorylation status of gammaH2AX in vivo and efficiently dephosphorylates gammaH2AX in vitro. gammaH2AX is lost from chromatin surrounding a DSB independently of the HTP-C, indicating that the phosphatase targets gammaH2AX after its displacement from DNA. The dephosphorylation of gammaH2AX by the HTP-C is necessary for efficient recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint.},

abstract = {Double-strand break (DSB) damage in yeast and mammalian cells induces the rapid ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated)/ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related)-dependent phosphorylation of histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX). In budding yeast, a single endonuclease-induced DSB triggers gamma-H2AX modification of 50 kb on either side of the DSB. The extent of gamma-H2AX spreading does not depend on the chromosomal sequences. DNA resection after DSB formation causes the slow, progressive loss of gamma-H2AX from single-stranded DNA and, after several hours, the Mec1 (ATR)-dependent spreading of gamma-H2AX to more distant regions. Heterochromatic sequences are only weakly modified upon insertion of a 3-kb silent HMR locus into a gamma-H2AX-covered region. The presence of heterochromatin does not stop the phosphorylation of chromatin more distant from the DSB. In mouse embryo fibroblasts, gamma-H2AX distribution shows that gamma-H2AX foci increase in size as chromatin becomes more accessible. In yeast, we see a high level of constitutive gamma-H2AX in telomere regions in the absence of any exogenous DNA damage, suggesting that yeast chromosome ends are transiently detected as DSBs.},

The modification and deposition of specific histone variants play key roles in chromatin function. In this study, we established an in vitro system based on permeabilized cells that allows the assembly and exchange of histones in situ. H2A and H2B, each tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), are incorporated into euchromatin by exchange independently of DNA replication, and H3.1-GFP is assembled into replicated chromatin, as found in living cells. By purifying the cellular factors that assist in the incorporation of H2A-H2B, we identified protein phosphatase (PP) 2C gamma subtype (PP2Cgamma/PPM1G) as a histone chaperone that binds to and dephosphorylates H2A-H2B. The disruption of PP2Cgamma in chicken DT40 cells increased the sensitivity to caffeine, a reagent that disturbs DNA replication and damage checkpoints, suggesting the involvement of PP2Cgamma-mediated histone dephosphorylation and exchange in damage response or checkpoint recovery in higher eukaryotes.},

The Rad52 group proteins are highly conserved among eukaryotes.

abstract = {ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable) have been implicated in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and damage responses. However, the regulatory mechanisms that control the function of chromatin remodelers in DNA damage response are largely unknown. Here, we show that ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) mediates the phosphorylation of BRG1, the catalytic ATPase of the SWI/SNF complex that contributes to DSB repair by binding $\gamma$-H2AX-containing nucleosomes via interaction with acetylated histone H3 and stimulating $\gamma$-H2AX formation, at Ser-721 in response to DNA damage. ATM-mediated phosphorylation of BRG1 occurs rapidly and transiently after DNA damage. Phosphorylated BRG1 binds $\gamma$-H2AX-containing nucleosomes to form the repair foci. The Ser-721 phosphorylation of BRG1 is critical for binding $\gamma$-H2AX-containing nucleosomes and stimulating $\gamma$-H2AX formation and DSB repair. BRG1 binds to acetylated H3 peptides much better after phosphorylation at Ser-721 by DNA damage. However, the phosphorylation of Ser-721 does not significantly affect the ATPase and transcriptional activities of BRG1. These results, establishing BRG1 as a novel and functional ATM substrate, suggest that the ATM-mediated phosphorylation of BRG1 facilitates DSB repair by stimulating the association of this remodeler with $\gamma$-H2AX nucleosomes via enhancing the affinity to acetylated H3. Our work also suggests that the mechanism of BRG1 stimulation of DNA repair is independent of the remodeler's enzymatic or transcriptional activities.},

We describe Mec1- and Tel1-dependent phosphorylation of histone H2B at T129. $\gamma$-H2B formation is impaired by $\gamma$-H2AX and its binding partner Rad9. High-density microarray analyses show similar $\gamma$-H2AX and $\gamma$-H2B distributions, but $\gamma$-H2B is absent near telomeres. Both $\gamma$-H2AX and $\gamma$-H2B are strongly diminished over highly transcribed regions. When transcription of GAL7, GAL10 and GAL1 genes is turned off, $\gamma$-H2AX is restored within 5 min, in a Mec1-dependent manner; after reinduction of these genes, $\gamma$-H2AX is rapidly lost. Moreover, when a DSB is induced near CEN2, $\gamma$-H2AX spreads to all other pericentromeric regions, again depending on Mec1. Our data provide new insights in the function and establishment of phosphorylation events occurring on chromatin after DSB induction.},

abstract = {The detection of a DNA double-strand break (DSB) is necessary to initiate DSB repair. Several proteins, including the MRX/N complex, Tel1/ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), and Mec1/ATR (ATM and Rad3 related), have been proposed as sensors of DNA damage, yet how they recognize the breaks is poorly understood. DSBs occur in the context of chromatin, implicating factors capable of altering local and/or global chromatin structure in the cellular response to DNA damage, including DSB sensing. Emerging evidence indicates that ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes function in DNA repair. Here we describe an important and novel early role for the RSC ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler linked to DSB sensing in the cell's DNA-damage response. RSC is required for full levels of H2A phosphorylation because it facilitates the recruitment of Tel1/ATM and Mec1/ATR to the break site. Consistent with these results, we also show that Rsc2 is needed for efficient activation of the Rad53-dependent checkpoint, as well as for Cohesin's association with the break site. Finally, Rsc2 is needed for the DNA-damage-induced changes in nucleosome structure surrounding the DSB site. Together, these new findings functionally link RSC to DSB sensing, highlighting the importance of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factors in the cell's early response to DNA damage.},

abstract = {Double-strand DNA breaks are common events in eukaryotic cells, and there are two major pathways for repairing them: homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ). The various causes of double-strand breaks (DSBs) result in a diverse chemistry of DNA ends that must be repaired. Across NHEJ evolution, the enzymes of the NHEJ pathway exhibit a remarkable degree of structural tolerance in the range of DNA end substrate configurations upon which they can act. In vertebrate cells, the nuclease, DNA polymerases, and ligase of NHEJ are the most mechanistically flexible and multifunctional enzymes in each of their classes. Unlike repair pathways for more defined lesions, NHEJ repair enzymes act iteratively, act in any order, and can function independently of one another at each of the two DNA ends being joined. NHEJ is critical not only for the repair of pathologic DSBs as in chromosomal translocations, but also for the repair of physiologic DSBs created during variable (diversity) joining [V(D)J] recombination and class switch recombination (CSR). Therefore, patients lacking normal NHEJ are not only sensitive to ionizing radiation (IR), but also severely immunodeficient.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity causes the rapid expression of immediate early genes that are crucial for experience-driven changes to synapses, learning, and memory. Here, using both molecular and genome-wide next-generation sequencing methods, we report that neuronal activity stimulation triggers the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in the promoters of a subset of early-response genes, including Fos, Npas4, and Egr1. Generation of targeted DNA DSBs within Fos and Npas4 promoters is sufficient to induce their expression even in the absence of an external stimulus. Activity-dependent DSB formation is likely mediated by the type II topoisomerase, Topoisomerase II?? (Topo II??), and knockdown of Topo II?? attenuates both DSB formation and early-response gene expression following neuronal stimulation. Our results suggest that DSB formation is a physiological event that rapidly resolves topological constraints to early-response gene expression in neurons. PaperClip},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating-type switching is initiated by a double-strand break (DSB) at MATa, leaving one cut end perfectly homologous to the HML$\alpha$ donor, while the second end must be processed to remove a non-homologous tail before completing repair by gene conversion (GC). When homology at the matched end is ≤150 bp, efficient repair depends on the recombination enhancer, which tethers HML$\alpha$ near the DSB. Thus, homology shorter than an apparent minimum efficient processing segment can be rescued by tethering the donor near the break. When homology at the second end is ≤150 bp, second-end capture becomes inefficient and repair shifts from GC to break-induced replication (BIR). But when pol32 or pif1 mutants block BIR, GC increases 3-fold, indicating that the steps blocked by these mutations are reversible. With short second-end homology, absence of the RecQ helicase Sgs1 promotes gene conversion, whereas deletion of the FANCM-related Mph1 helicase promotes BIR.},

abstract = {There are many types of DNA damage that are repaired by a multiplicity of different repair pathways. All damage and repair occur in the context of chromatin, and histone modifications are involved in many repair processes. We have analyzed the roles of H2A and its modifications in repair by mutagenizing modifiable residues in the N- and C-terminal tails of yeast H2A and by testing strains containing these mutations in multiple DNA repair assays. We show that residues in both tails are important for homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining pathways of double-strand break repair, as well as for survival of UV irradiation and oxidative damage. We show that H2A serine 122 is important for repair and/or survival in each of these assays. We also observe a complex pattern of H2A phosphorylation at residues S122, T126, and S129 in response to different damage conditions. We find that overlapping but nonidentical groups of H2A residues in both tails are involved in different pathways of repair. These data suggest the presence of a set of H2A "damage codes" in which distinct patterns of modifications on both tails of H2A may be used to identify specific types of damage or to promote specific repair pathways.},

The evidence suggests a number of different pathways for DNA double-strand break rejoining in mammalian cells, but it is unclear what factors determine the fate of the induced break and whether or not it will lead to chromosomal rearrangement. If a cell does survive and proliferate after DNA cleavage, delayed chromosomal instability can be observed in the clonal descendants of the exposed cell. Most, but not all DNA double-strand breaking agents are effective at inducing this delayed chromosomal instability. In this paper, we review the evidence for the role of the DNA double-strand break in directly induced and delayed chromosomal rearrangements.},

abstract = {Chromatin in the interphase nucleus moves in a constrained random walk. Despite extensive study, the molecular causes of such movement and its impact on DNA-based reactions are unclear. Using high-precision live fluorescence microscopy in budding yeast, we quantified the movement of tagged chromosomal loci to which transcriptional activators or nucleosome remodeling complexes were targeted. We found that local binding of the transcriptional activator VP16, but not of the Gal4 acidic domain, enhances chromatin mobility. The increase in movement did not correlate strictly with RNA polymerase II (PolII) elongation, but could be phenocopied by targeting the INO80 remodeler to the locus. Enhanced chromatin mobility required Ino80's ATPase activity. Consistently, the INO80-dependent remodeling of nucleosomes upon transcriptional activation of the endogenous PHO5 promoter enhanced chromatin movement locally. Finally, increased mobility at a double-strand break was also shown to depend in part on the INO80 complex. This correlated with increased rates of spontaneous gene conversion. We propose that local chromatin remodeling and nucleosome eviction increase large-scale chromatin movements by enhancing the flexibility of the chromatin fiber.},

The complex acts as a break sensor and functions in the activation and propagation of signaling pathways that govern cell cycle checkpoint functions in response to DNA damage. In addition, the Mre11 complex influences recombinational DNA repair through promoting recombination between sister chromatids. The Mre11 complex is required for mammalian cell viability but hypomorphic mutants of Mre11 and Nbs1 have been identified in human genetic instability disorders. These hypomorphic mutations, as well as those identified in yeast, have provided a benchmark for establishing mouse models of Mre11 complex deficiency. In addition to consideration of Mre11 complex functions in human cells and yeast, this review will discuss the characterization of mouse models and insight gleaned from those models regarding the metabolism of chromosome breaks. The current picture of break metabolism supports a central role for the Mre11 complex at the interface of chromosome stability and the regulation of cell growth. Further genetic analysis of the Mre11 complex will be an invaluable tool for dissecting its function on an organismal level and determining its role in the prevention of malignancy.},

abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are cytotoxic lesions that can result in mutagenic events or cell death if left unrepaired or repaired inappropriately. Cells use two major pathways for DSB repair: nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). The choice between these pathways depends on the phase of the cell cycle and the nature of the DSB ends. A critical determinant of repair pathway choice is the initiation of 5'-3' resection of DNA ends, which commits cells to homology-dependent repair, and prevents repair by classical NHEJ. Here, we review the components of the end resection machinery, the role of end structure, and the cell-cycle phase on resection and the interplay of end processing with NHEJ.},

abstract = {Catalytically active proteins with divergent dual functions are often described as 'moonlighting'. In this work we characterize a new, chromatin-based function of Lys20, a moonlighting protein that is well known for its role in metabolism. Lys20 was initially described as homocitrate synthase (HCS), the first enzyme in the lysine biosynthetic pathway in yeast. Its nuclear localization led to the discovery of a key role for Lys20 in DNA damage repair through its interaction with the MYST family histone acetyltransferase Esa1. Overexpression of Lys20 promotes suppression of DNA damage sensitivity of esa1 mutants. In this work, by taking advantage of LYS20 mutants that are active in repair but not in lysine biosynthesis, the mechanism of suppression of esa1 was characterized. First we analyzed the chromatin landscape of esa1 cells, finding impaired histone acetylation and eviction. Lys20 was recruited to sites of DNA damage, and its overexpression promoted enhanced recruitment of the INO80 remodeling complex to restore normal histone eviction at the damage sites. This study improves understanding of the evolutionary, structural and biological relevance of independent activities in a moonlighting protein and links metabolism to DNA damage repair.},

abstract = {In eukaryotes, double-stranded break repair (DSB) takes place in the context of chromatin. Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating type (MAT) switching provides an opportunity to investigate nucleosome dynamics around a well-characterized DSB. MAT switching is initiated by synchronous induction of a DSB by HO endonuclease at the MAT locus following which the DSB ends are resected and the Rad51 recombinase is loaded on the 3-ended single strand. Rad51 facilitates strand invasion with a homologous donor sequence, which is required for initiation of new DNA synthesis and the resulting repair. A hurdle in studying nucleosome positioning around the MAT locus has been the weak nucleosome positioning around the MAT locus relative to the heterochromatic donors HML and HMR. To address this hurdle we designed a novel system in which we inserted the Xenopus laevis 5S nucleosome positioning sequence adjacent to the MAT locus. Using this system we have, for the first time, monitored the loss of chromatin protection following resection of the DSB end and the re-establishment of chromatin structure following repair. We show that nucleosome protection is lost around a DSB in a resection-dependent manner. Further, we show that nucleosome protection is reestablished following repair of a DSB but not to the level of protection seen prior to induction of a DSB. This reestablishment depends on repair of the DSB and not on passage through the cell cycle. We show that complete protection is reestablished after several cell cycles, suggesting that there is a mechanistic difference between repair-dependent and replication-dependent nucleosome positioning.},

abstract = {Homologous recombination (HR) is an evolutionarily conserved pathway in eukaryotes that repairs a double-strand break (DSB) by copying homologous sequences from a sister chromatid, a homologous chromosome or an ectopic location. Recombination is challenged by the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes, which may impair the process at many steps, from resection of the DSB ends to the re-establishement of nucleosomes after repair. However, nucleosome dynamics during DSB repair have not been well described, primarily because of a lack of well-ordered nucleosomes around a DSB. We designed a system in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to monitor nucleosome dynamics during repair of an HO endonuclease-induced DSB. Nucleosome occupancy around the break is lost following DSB formation, by 5??????3??? resection of the DSB end. Soon after repair is complete, nucleosome occupancy is partially restored in a repair-dependent but cell cycle-independent manner. Full re-establishment of nucleosome protection back to the level prior to DSB induction is achieved when the cell cycle resumes following repair. These findings may have implications to the mechanisms by which cells sense the completion of repair.},

abstract = {The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is crucial for maintaining genome stability. Eukaryotic cells repair DSBs by both non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination. How chromatin structure is altered in response to DSBs and how such alterations influence DSB repair processes are important issues. In vertebrates, phosphorylation of the histone variant H2A.X occurs rapidly after DSB formation, spreads over megabase chromatin domains, and is required for stable accumulation of repair proteins at damage foci. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, phosphorylation of the two principal H2A species is also signalled by DSB formation, which spreads approximately 40 kb in either direction from the DSB. Here we show that near a DSB phosphorylation of H2A is followed by loss of histones H2B and H3 and increased sensitivity of chromatin to digestion by micrococcal nuclease; however, phosphorylation of H2A and nucleosome loss occur independently. The DNA damage sensor MRX is required for histone loss, which also depends on INO80, a nucleosome remodelling complex. The repair protein Rad51 (ref. 6) shows delayed recruitment to DSBs in the absence of histone loss, suggesting that MRX-dependent nucleosome remodelling regulates the accessibility of factors directly involved in DNA repair by homologous recombination. Thus, MRX may regulate two pathways of chromatin changes: nucleosome displacement for efficient recruitment of homologous recombination proteins; and phosphorylation of H2A, which modulates checkpoint responses to DNA damage.},

abstract = {Chromatin remodeling is emerging as a critical regulator of DNA repair factor access to DNA damage, and optimum accessibility of these factors is a major determinant of DNA repair outcome. Hence, chromatin remodeling is likely to play a key role in genome stabilization and tumor suppression. We previously showed that nucleosome eviction near double-strand breaks (DSBs) in yeast is regulated by the INO80 nucleosome remodeling complex and is defective in mutants lacking the Arp8 subunit of INO80. In the absence of homologous donor sequences, RPA recruitment to a DSB appeared normal in arp8??, but Rad51 recruitment was defective. We now show that the early strand invasion step of homologous recombination (HR) is markedly delayed in an arp8?? haploid, but there is only a minor defect in haploid HR efficiency (MAT switching). In an arp8?? diploid, interhomolog DSB repair by HR shows a modest defect that is partially suppressed by overexpression of Rad51 or its mediator, Rad52. In wild type cells, DSB repair typically results in gene conversion, and most gene conversion tracts are continuous, reflecting efficient mismatch repair of heteroduplex DNA. In contrast, arp8?? gene conversion tracts are longer and frequently discontinuous, indicating defects in late stages of HR. Interestingly, when a homologous donor sequence is present, Rad51 is recruited normally to a DSB in arp8??, but its transfer to the donor is delayed, and this correlates with defective displacement of donor nucleosomes. We propose that retained nucleosomes at donors destabilize heteroduplex DNA or impair mismatch recognition, reflected in delayed strand invasion and altered conversion tracts. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Cell imaging development relies on technical advances as well as our knowledge of the cell DNA damage response (DDR) process. The DDR involves a complex network of proteins that initiate and coordinate DNA damage signaling and repair activities. As some DDR proteins assemble at DSBs in an established spatio-temporal pattern, visible nuclear foci are produced. In addition, post-translational modifications are important for the signaling and the recruitment of specific partners at damaged chromatin foci. We briefly review here the most widely used methods to study DSBs. We also discuss the development of indirect methods, using reporter expression or intra-nuclear antibodies, to follow the production of DSBs in real time and in living cells.},

abstract = {SWI/SNF is a chromatin remodeling complex that affects transcription initiation and elongation by RNA polymerase II. Here we report that SWI/SNF also plays a role in transcription by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of the genes encoding the Snf6p or Snf5p subunits of SWI/SNF was lethal in combination with mutations that impair Pol I transcription initiation and elongation. SWI/SNF physically associated with ribosomal DNA (rDNA) within the coding region, with an apparent peak near the 5' end of the gene. In snf6$\Delta$ cells there was a ∼2.5-fold reduction in rRNA synthesis rate compared to WT, but there was no change in average polymerase occupancy per gene, the number of rDNA gene repeats, or the percentage of transcriptionally active rDNA genes. However, both ChIP and EM analyses showed a small but reproducible increase in Pol I density in a region near the 5' end of the gene. Based on these data, we conclude that SWI/SNF plays a positive role in Pol I transcription, potentially by modifying chromatin structure in the rDNA repeats. Our findings demonstrate that SWI/SNF influences the most robust transcription machinery in proliferating cells.},

However, the mechanisms used to expose DSBs to the repair machinery and to restore the chromatin organization after repair remain elusive. Here we show that induction of a DSB in human cells causes local nucleosome disassembly, apparently independently from DNA end resection. This efficient removal of histone H3 from the genome during non-homologous end joining was promoted by both ATM and the ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeler INO80. Chromatin reassembly during DSB repair was dependent on the HIRA histone chaperone that is specific to the replication-independent histone variant H3.3 and on CAF-1 that is specific to the replication-dependent canonical histones H3.1/H3.2. Our data suggest that the epigenetic information is re-established after DSB repair by the concerted and interdependent action of replication-independent and replication-dependent chromatin assembly pathways.</p>},
